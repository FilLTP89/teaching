(2008) source model that combines the available geodetic and seismic observations and recently constructed 3D geologic and seismic velocity models. Our estimates of the ground motions for the 1906 earthquake are consistent across five ground-motion modeling groups employing different wave propagation codes and simulation domains. The simulations successfully reproduce the main features of the Boatwright and Bundock (2005) ShakeMap, but tend to over predict the intensity of shaking by 0.1–0.5 modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) units. Velocity waveforms at sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area exhibit characteristics consistent with rupture directivity, local geologic conditions (e.g., sedimentary basins), and the large size of the event (e.g., durations of strong shaking lasting tens of seconds). We also compute ground motions for seven hypothetical scenarios rupturing the same extent of the northern San Andreas fault, considering three additional hypocenters and an additional, random distribution of slip. Rupture directivity exerts the strongest influence on the variations in shaking, although sedimentary basins do consistently contribute to the response in some locations, such as Santa Rosa, Livermore, and San Jose. These scenarios suggest that future large earthquakes on the northern San Andreas fault may subject the current San Francisco Bay urban area to stronger shaking than a repeat of the 1906 earthquake. Ruptures propagating southward towards San Francisco appear to expose more of the urban area to a given intensity level than do ruptures propagating northward.},

(1991) source models of the 1989 magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake using four different wave-propagation codes and recently developed 3D geologic and seismic velocity models. In preparation for modeling the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, we use this well-recorded earthquake to characterize how well our ground-motion simulations reproduce the observed shaking intensities and amplitude and durations of recorded motions throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. All of the simulations generate ground motions consistent with the large-scale spatial variations in shaking associated with rupture directivity and the geologic structure. We attribute the small variations among the synthetics to the minimum shear-wave speed permitted in the simulations and how they accommodate topography. Our long-period simulations, on average, under predict shaking intensities by about one-half modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) units (25%?35% in peak velocity), while our broadband simulations, on average, under predict the shaking intensities by one-fourth MMI units (16% in peak velocity). Discrepancies with observations arise due to errors in the source models and geologic structure. The consistency in the synthetic waveforms across the wave-propagation codes for a given source model suggests the uncertainty in the source parameters tends to exceed the uncertainty in the seismic velocity structure. In agreement with earlier studies, we find that a source model with slip more evenly distributed northwest and southeast of the hypocenter would be preferable to both the Beroza and Wald source models. Although the new 3D seismic velocity model improves upon previous velocity models, we identify two areas needing improvement. Nevertheless, we find that the seismic velocity model and the wave-propagation codes are suitable for modeling the 1906 earthquake and scenario events in the San Francisco Bay Area.},

For rupture on the Hayward fault, we consider the effects of creep on coseismic slip using two different approaches, both of which reduce the ground motions, compared with neglecting the influence of creep. Nevertheless, the scenario earthquakes generate strong shaking throughout the San Francisco Bay area, with about 50% of the urban area experiencing modified Mercalli intensity VII or greater for the magnitude 7.0 scenario events. Long-period simulations of the 2007 Mw 4.18 Oakland earthquake and the 2007 Mw 5.45 Alum Rock earthquake show that the U.S. Geological Survey’s Bay Area Velocity Model version 08.3.0 permits simulation of the amplitude and duration of shaking throughout the San Francisco Bay area for Hayward fault earthquakes, with the greatest accuracy in the Santa Clara Valley (San Jose area). The ground motions for the suite of scenarios exhibit a strong sensitivity to the rupture length (or magnitude), hypocenter (or rupture directivity), and slip distribution. The ground motions display a much weaker sensitivity to the rise time and rupture speed. Peak velocities, peak accelerations, and spectral accelerations from the synthetic broadband ground motions are, on average, slightly higher than the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) ground-motion prediction equations. We attribute much of this difference to the seismic velocity structure in the San Francisco Bay area and how the NGA models account for basin amplification; the NGA relations may underpredict amplification in shallow sedimentary basins. The simulations also suggest that the Spudich and Chiou (2008) directivity corrections to the NGA relations could be improved by increasing the areal extent of rupture directivity with period.},

We use these rupture models in 3D ground-motion simulations as discussed in Part II (Aagaard et al., 2010) to provide detailed estimates of the shaking for each scenario. We employ both geophysical constraints and empirical relations to provide realistic variation in the rupture dimensions, slip heterogeneity, hypocenters, rupture speeds, and rise times. The five rupture lengths include portions of the Hayward fault as well as combined rupture of the Hayward and Rodgers Creek faults and the Hayward and Calaveras faults. We vary rupture directivity using multiple hypocenters, typically three per rupture length, yielding north-to-south rupture, bilateral rupture, and south-to-north rupture. For each rupture length and hypocenter, we consider multiple random distributions of slip. We use two approaches to account for how aseismic creep might reduce coseismic slip. For one subset of scenarios, we follow the slip-predictable approach and reduce the nominal slip in creeping regions according to the creep rate and time since the most recent earthquake, whereas for another subset of scenarios we apply a vertical gradient to the nominal slip in creeping regions. The rupture models include local variations in rupture speed and use a ray-tracing algorithm to propagate the rupture front. Although we are not attempting to simulate the 1868 Hayward fault earthquake in detail, a few of the scenarios are designed to have source parameters that might be similar to this historical event.},

  abstract  = {In soil-structure interaction modeling of systems subjected to earthquake motions, it is classically assumed that the incoming wave field, produced by an earthquake, is unidimensional and vertically propagating. This work explores the validity of this assumption by performing earthquake soil-structure interaction modeling, including explicit modeling of sources, seismic wave propagation, site, and structure. The domain reduction method is used to couple seismic (near-field) simulations with local soil-structure interaction response. The response of a generic nuclear power plant model computed using full earthquake soil-structure interaction simulations is compared with the current state-of-the-art method of deconvolving in depth the (simulated) free-field motions, recorded at the site of interest, and assuming that the earthquake wave field is spatially unidimensional. Results show that the 1-D wave-field assumption does not hold in general. It is shown that the way in which full 3-D analysis results differ from those which assume a 1-D wave field is dependent on fault-to-site geometry and motion frequency content. It is argued that this is especially important for certain classes of soil-structure systems of which nuclear power plants subjected to near-field earthquakes are an example.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a description of a granular medium as a stochastic heterogeneous continuum medium. The heterogeneity of the material properties field recreates the heterogeneous stress field in a granular medium. The stochastic approach means that only statistical information, easily available, is required to construct the model. The heterogeneous continuum model is Calibrated with respect to discrete simulations of a set of railway ballast samples. As they are continuum-based, the equilibrium equations can be solved on a large scale using a parallel implementation of an explicit time discretization scheme for the Finite Element Method. Simulations representative of the influence on the environment of the passage of a train on a ballasted railway track clearly show the influence of the heterogeneity. These simulations seem to correlate well with previously unexplained overly damped measurements in the free field.},

His results and other pertinent data, interpreted in terms of the barrier model of Das and Aki (1977), suggest that the rupture may be stopped by a barrier with the specific fracture energy of about 109 erg cm−2. Using the formulas of Ida (1973a), we estimated parameters of the barrier as follows: breaking slip of about 20 cm, cohesive stress of about 100 bars, and length of end zone (nonelastic zone) of a few hundred meters. The barrier parameters for the great 1857 earthquake were also obtained from the description of surface fault breaks by Wallace (1968). The result led to the estimation of maximum acceleration of about 1.5g near the fault, under the assumption that the end zone length is proportional to the diameter of individual crack of the barrier model. Barriers for other earthquakes are discussed, and they are classified into geometrical barriers such as fault bend and corner and inhomogeneous barriers such as the high-velocity anomaly straddling the San Andreas fault near San Juan Bautista. The barriers act not only as a stopper of rupture but also as an initiator of rupture, as well as a stress concentrator, causing twin earthquakes and migration or progression of major earthquakes along the plate boundary.},

  Abstract                 = {A method was devised to extract useful information about the earthquake source from the coda of local small earthquakes. The method is based on the assumption that the power spectrum of coda waves of a local earthquake is only a function of time measured from the earthquake origin time and independent of distance and details of wave path to the station. Evidence supporting this assumption is presented, using the data on aftershocks of the Parkfield earthquakes of June 28, 1966. A simple statistical model of the wave medium that accounts for the observations on the coda is proposed. By applying the method to many Parkfield aftershocks, the relation between the seismic moment M0 and local magnitude ML is determined as log M0 (dyne cm) = 15.8 + 1.5ML. The size of a microearthquake with magnitude zero is estimated as 10×10 meters.},

  Abstract                 = {Ground motion at only 80 meters from the San Andreas fault was recorded during the Parkfield earthquake of June 28, 1966, by the accelerographs of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Seismic displacements obtained from the accelerograms are compared with synthetic seismograms calculated for a moving dislocation model. An excellent agreement was obtained between the observed and theoretical seismograms. The dislocation is the only important source parameter that controls the seismic motion at such short distances. Other parameters such as the fault length and depth show negligible effect of the motion. The rupture velocity is a significant but not dominant factor. From the comparison of observed and theoretical seismograms, it was concluded that the fault dislocation was about 60 cm. This value is an order of magnitude greater than the fault offset observed at the surface. This discrepancy was attributed to the decoupling of a thin surface layer (probably less than 100 meters from the surface). The fault depth was estimated by combining the estimated dislocation with the seismic moment obtained from long-period surface waves. The fault depth within the basement rock was found to be about 3 km, which is significantly smaller than the depth (15 km) of the aftershock zone. This discrepancy was attributed to the effect of increasing friction with depth which momentarily prevented downward extension of rupture during the main shock.},

  Abstract                 = {The dependence of the amplitude spectrum of seismic waves on source size is investigated on the basis of two dislocation models of an earthquake source. One of the models (by N. Haskell) is called the ?� model, and the other, called the ?� model, is constructed by fitting an exponentially decaying function to the autocorrelation function of the dislocation velocity. The number of source parameters is reduced to one by the assumption of similarity. We found that the most convenient parameter for our purpose is the magnitude Ms, defined for surface waves with period of 20 sec. Spectral density curves are determined for given Ms. Comparison of the theoretical curves with observations is made in two different ways. The observed ratios of the spectra of seismic waves with the same propagation path but from earthquakes of different sizes are compared with the corresponding theoretical ratios, thereby eliminating the effect of propagation on the spectrum. The other method is to check the theory with the empirical relation between different magnitude scales defined for different waves at different periods. The ?� model gives a satisfactory agreement with such observations on the assumption of similarity, but the ?� model does not. We find, however, some indications of departure from similarity. The efficiency of seismic radiation seems to increase with decreasing magnitude if the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-energy relation is valid. The assumption of similarity implies a constant stress drop independent of source size. A preliminary study of Love waves from the Parkfield earthquake of June 28, 1966, shows that the stress drop at the source of this earthquake is lower than the normal value (around 100 bars) by about 2 orders of magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {Coda waves from small local earthquakes are interpreted as backscattering waves from numerous heterogeneities distributed uniformly in the earth's crust. Two extreme models of the wave medium that account for the observations on the coda are proposed. In the single backscattering model the scattering is considered to be a weak process, and the loss of seismic energy by scattering is neglected. In the diffusion model the seismic energy transfer is considered as a diffusion process. Both models lead to similar formulas that allow an accurate separation of the effect of earthquake source from the effects of scattering and attenuation on the coda spectra. A unique difference was found in the scaling law of earthquake source spectra between central California and western Japan, which may be attributed to the difference in inhomogeneity length of the earth's crust. The Q of coda waves in the two regions is strongly frequency dependent with values increasing from 50-200 at 1 Hz to about 1000-2000 at 20 Hz. This observation is interpreted as a combined effect of variation of Q with depth and frequency-dependent composition of coda waves described below. The turbidity coefficient of the lithosphere required at 1 Hz to explain the observed coda as body wave scattering is orders of magnitude greater than previously known values such as those obtained by Aki (1973) and Capon (1974) under the Montana Lasa from the amplitude and phase fluctuations of teleseismic P waves. From the high attenuation and turbidity obtained at this frequency we conclude that at around 1 Hz the coda is made of backscattering surface waves from heterogeneities in the shallow, low-Q lithosphere. The high Q observed for the coda at frequencies higher than 10 Hz, on the other hand, eliminates the possibility that these waves are backscattering surface waves. We conclude that at these high frequencies the coda must be made of backscattering body waves from heterogeneities in the deep lithosphere. The low turbidities found for deep earthquake sources under western Japan are consistent with this model of coda wave generation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the overall procedure followed in order to assemble the most recent pan-European strong-motion databank: Reference Database for Seismic Ground-Motion in Europe (RESORCE). RESORCE is one of the products of the SeIsmic Ground Motion Assessment (SIGMA; projet-sigma.com) project. RESORCE is intended to be a single integrated accelerometric databank for Europe and surrounding areas for use in the development and testing of ground-motion models and for other engineering seismology and earthquake engineering applications. RESORCE aims to contribute to the improvement of earthquake risk studies in Europe and surrounding areas. RESORCE principally updates and extends the previous pan-European strong-motion databank (Ambraseys et al. in Bollettino di Geofisica Teorica ed Applicata 45:113--129, 2004a) with recently compiled Greek, Italian, Swiss and Turkish accelerometric archives. The updates also include earthquake-specific studies published in recent years. The current content of RESORCE includes 5,882 multi-component and uniformly processed accelerograms from 1,814 events and 1,540 strong-motion stations. The moment magnitude range covered by RESORCE is {\$}{\$}2.8 {\backslash}le {\backslash}hbox {\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}w{\}}{\}} {\backslash}le 7.8{\$}{\$} 2.8 ≤ M w ≤ 7.8 . The source-to-site distance interval extends to 587 km and distance information is given by the common point- and extended-source distance measures. The paper presents the current features of RESORCE through simple statistics that also quantify the differences in metadata and strong-motion processing with respect to the previous version of the pan-European strong-motion databank.},

Some of the heterogeneous materials can exhibit power law scaling in material behavior which can be characterized by the fractal dimension of the microstructure. In this study, wave propagation in heterogeneous media with self-similar structure is investigated via fractional calculus along with space-time discontinuous Galerkin method. One and two dimensional problems are studied to demonstrate the capability of the proposed model in modeling heterogeneous media. The results show that the proposed model is a good candidate for modeling the mechanical behavior of disordered materials.},

In order to link the qualitative numbers extracted from the acceleration record of an earthquake and other instrumental data such as peak ground velocity, epicentral distance, and moment magnitude on the one hand and the modified Mercalli intensity scale on the other, simple statistical regression has been generally employed. In this paper, we will employ three methods of nonlinear regression, namely support vector regression, multilayer perceptrons, and genetic programming in order to find a functional dependence between the instrumental records and the modified Mercalli intensity scale. The proposed methods predict the intensity of an earthquake while dealing with nonlinearity and the noise inherent to the data. The nonlinear regressions with good estimation results have been performed using the "Did You Feel It?" database of the US Geological Survey and the database of the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data for the California region. {\copyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {To develop credibility of synthetic seismograms for engineering applications, there is a need for a quantitative score that can be used to characterize the how well the synthetic matches the statistical characteristics of observed records. Recognizing that strong motion is a very complex time series and any measure that relies on a single parameter for the comparison is seriously incomplete, this paper examines use of a suite of measurements. To be specific, we score seismograms that have been filtered into up to ten narrow pass-bands. Each frequency band is scored on ten different characteristics. The characteristics scored are the peak acceleration, peak velocity, peak displacement, Arias intensity, the integral of velocity squared, Fourier spectrum and acceleration response spectrum on a frequency-by-frequency basis, the shape of the normalized integrals of acceleration and velocity squared, and the cross correlation. Each characteristic is compared on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 giving perfect agreement. Scores for each parameter are averaged to yield an overall quality of fit. A score below 4 is a poor fit, a score of 4-6 is a fair fit, a score of 6 to 8 is a good fit, and a score over 8 is an excellent fit. One horizontal component of an actual seismogram typically fits the other horizontal component in the {\textquotedblleft}good{\textquotedblright} range. The method is applied to a blind prediction of ground motions at a station 3 km from the fault in the M7.9 Denali Fault, Alaska, earthquake of November 3, 2002.},

  Abstract                 = {At high frequencies f the spectrum of S-wave accelerations is characterized by a trend of exponential decay, e-πkf. In our study, the spectral decay parameter k shows little variation at a single station for multiple earthquakes at the same distances, but it increases gradually as the epicentral distance increases. For multiple recordings of the San Fernando earthquake, k increases slowly with distance, and k is systematically smaller for sites on rock than for sites on alluvium. Under the assumption that the Fourier spectrum of acceleration at the source is constant above the corner frequency (an ω-2 source model), the exponential decay is consistent with an attenuation model in which Q increases rapidly with depth in the shallow crustal layers.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-oki earthquake generated strong ground motions in Kashiwazaki and Kariwa, where the world largest nuclear power plant was in operation. Due to the complexity of the aftershock distribution, activation of the northwest-dipping fault and/or the southeast-dipping fault is proposed. To explore the fault geometry and source process of the earthquake, we performed multi-time window linear waveform inversions for both the fault planes from near-fault strong motion data. A fault plane model of 30 km in length by 24 km in width was set to cover the region of aftershock distribution within 24 h of the mainshock. Both inverted slip models provided moment magnitudes of 6.7 with a small asperity near the rupture starting point, and a large asperity approximately 10 km southwest of the rupture initiation, which is located in the region of relatively sparse aftershock distribution. Both the small and large asperities are located near the intersection between the two conjugate fault plane models, and the asperities of both models have similar radiation patterns. Therefore, the difference of the residuals between the observed and synthetic waveforms for both models was not significant, indicating that it is difficult to conclude which fault is the rupture.},

  Abstract                 = {Global Positioning System (GPS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) detected substantial ground deformation due to the 2007 Chuetsu-Oki earthquake (Mw = 6.8); GPS observation detected a horizontal deformation of up to about 170 mm and subsidence of up to 30 mm, and InSAR detected up to 290 mm of line-of-sight changes. A fault model is proposed to fit the ground deformation field as well as the aftershock distribution. Our model shows that a northwest-dipping fault to the north and a southeast-dipping fault to the south, consistent with the aftershock distribution, fits well with the observed data. However, our model also suggests that the modeled faults are likely to extend to shallower depths, where aftershocks are terminated. Combining our model with the subsurface structure suggests that the earthquake rupture initiated at depth and propagated into shallower depths that are not capable of nucleating an earthquake because of the presence of unconsolidated sediments.},

Particle acceleration, velocity, and displacement at each station on the free surface is computed in the frequency band 0.0 to 5.0 Hz. The assumed dislocation is derived from the Kostrov (1964) displacement function for a continuously propagating stress relaxation. The azimuthal variations in the amplitudes and waveforms directly result from spatially varying slip on the fault, spatially varying radiation pattern over the fault, and the magnitude and direction of the rupture velocity. The near-source ground motions are dominated by the rupture in the direction of the receiver. Using a 100-bar effective stress (initial stress minus sliding friction) in a Poisson solid with β = 3.0 km/sec the shear wave speed, and shear modulus μ = 3.0 {\texttimes} 1011 dyne/cm2, the simulated earthquake has a moment Mo = 4.5 {\texttimes} 1025 dyne-cm. Using a rupture velocity of 0.9β, the peak acceleration is 1195 cm/sec2 and velocity 104 cm/sec for the receiver directly on strike. For a receiver 30{\textdegree} off strike, the maximum acceleration 236 cm/sec2 occurs on the vertical component.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The paper presents a numerical approach for the construction of seismic fragility curves for shallow metro tunnels considering the soil-structure-interaction (SSI) and the aging effects due to corrosion of the lining reinforcement. The tunnel response under ground shaking is evaluated through 2D non-linear dynamic analyses, for increasing levels of seismic intensity. An elasto-plastic model is used to simulate the soil non-linear behavior under ground shaking, while the effects of lining mechanical properties, soil conditions and ground motion characteristics are also accounted for. The effect of corrosion on the lining behavior is encountered through proper modification of the lining strength properties. Damage state thresholds are defined based on the exceedance of the lining capacity. The fragility curves are estimated in terms of peak ground acceleration at the ground free field conditions for different time periods considering the associated uncertainties. The proposed approach is applied for the fragility assessment of selected soil-tunnel configurations. The derived fragility functions are compared with existing empirical and analytical fragility models, highlighting the important role of soil conditions and corrosion effects in the vulnerability of tunnel structures. The proposed fragility models contribute towards an advanced vulnerability and risk assessment of transportation systems and infrastructures. },

Laboratory experimental data indicate that for highly confined materials, the standardized reduction curves commonly used overestimate the capacity of soils to dissipate energy. This paper first presents the results obtained with a simple four-parameter constitutive soil model, which when used to simulate cyclic loading, produces results that agree well with available laboratory experiments for soils under arbitrarily large confining pressures. Thereafter, a frequency- and pressure-dependent iterative algorithm for seismic amplification is proposed, which provides time histories that match well the results obtained with a true non-linear model. Finally, the modified linear iterative analysis is successfully used for the seismic analysis of a 1 km deep model for the Mississippi embayment near Memphis, Tennessee, and a class-A prediction of the seismic amplification in Treasure Island during the Loma Prieta earthquake.},

Inversion of low-amplitude waveforms is first employed for the estimation of low-strain dynamic soil properties at five stations. Successively, the frequency-dependent equivalent linear algorithm is used to predict the mainshock site response at these stations, by subjecting the best-fit elastic profiles to the downhole-recorded strong motion. Finally, inversion of the mainshock empirical site response is employed to extract the equivalent linear dynamic soil properties at the same locations. The inversion algorithm is shown to provide robust estimates of the linear and equivalent linear impedance profiles, while the attenuation structures are strongly affected by scattering effects in the near-surficial heterogeneous layers. The forward and inversely estimated equivalent linear shear wave velocity structures are found to be in very good agreement, illustrating that inversion of strong motion site response data may be used for the approximate assessment of nonlinear effects experienced by soil formations during strong motion events. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {In the p-version of the finite element method, the triangulation is fixed and the degree p, of the piecewise polynomial approximation, is progressively increased until some desired level of precision is reached. In this paper, we first establish the basic approximation properties of some spaces of piecewise polynomials defined on a finite element triangulation. These properties lead to an a priori estimate of the asymptotic rate of convergence of the p-version. The estimate shows that the p-version gives results which are not worse than those obtained by the conventional finite element method (called the h-version, in which h represents the maximum diameter of the elements), when quasi-uniform triangulations are employed and the basis for comparison is the number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, in the case of a singularity problem, we show (under conditions which are usually satisfied in practice) that the rate of convergence of the p-version is twice that of the h-version with quasi-uniform mesh. Inverse approximation theorems which determine the smoothness of a function based on the rate at which it is approximated by piecewise polynomials over a fixed triangulation are proved for both singular and nonsingular problems. We present numerical examples which illustrate the effectiveness of the p-version for a simple one-dimensional problem and for two problems in two-dimensional elasticity. We also discuss roundoff error and computational costs associated with the p-version. Finally, we describe some important features, such as hierarchic basis functions, which have been utilized in COMET-X, an experimental computer implementation of the p-version.},

  Abstract                 = {The restrictions imposed by the form-invariance principle on the structure of the elasto-plastic constitutive law for small strains are examined. It is shown that the yield and plastic potential functions may depend on the joint invariants of the stress and plastic strain tensors in addition to their dependence on the direct invariants of these tensors and additional scalar hardening parameters such as the plastic work; inclusion of the joint invariants as parameters in the constitutive functions allows for induced anisotropy during plastic deformation. It is demonstrated that the physical meaning of the joint invariants is related to the deviation of the principal directions of the stress tensor from those of the plastic strain tensor. It is also shown that only three cases of anisotropy (orthorhombic, transverse and isotropy) are possible in the types of material models discussed herein. The model proposed in this paper does not imply coaxiality between the principal directions of the stress and, plastic strain increment tensors; however, implications of the assumption of coaxiality on the structure of the constitutive equations is investigated. It is shown that coaxiality does not necessarily imply isotropy, but no deviations from coaxiality can be expected in isotropic materials.},

  Abstract                 = {For many soils experimental evidence suggests that deviation from normality between the plastic strain increments and the yield function is exhibited mainly in the volumetric behaviour, whereas the deviatoric behaviour exhibits normality. An analysis of the consequence of this observation is presented, and it leads to an expression for the plastic potential function as composed of two functions, a yield function and another dependent only on the hydrostatic pressure; the latter is considered to constitute the concept of correction functions presented recently by Desai and Siriwardane13.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of nonlinear static procedures for performance-based seismic design (PBSD) and assessment is a well-established practice, which has found its way into modern codes for quite some time. On the other hand, near-source (NS) ground motions are receiving increasing attention, because they can carry seismic demand systematically different and larger than that of the so-called ordinary records. This is due to phenomena such as rupture forward directivity (FD), which can lead to distinct pulses appearing in the velocity time-history of the ground motion. The framework necessary for taking FD into account in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) has recently been established. The objective of the present study is to discuss the extension of nonlinear static procedures, specifically the displacement coefficient method (DCM), with respect to the inelastic demand associated with FD. In this context, a methodology is presented for the implementation of the DCM toward estimating NS seismic demand, by making use of the results of NS-PSHA and a semi-empirical equation for NS-FD inelastic displacement ratio. An illustrative application of the DCM, with explicit inclusion of NS-pulse-like effects, is given for a set of typical plane R/C frames designed under Eurocode provisions. Different scenarios are considered in the application and nonlinear dynamic analysis results are obtained and discussed with respect to the static procedure estimates. Conclusions drawn from the results may help to assess the importance of incorporating NS effects in PBSD. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonlinear static procedures, which relate the seismic demand of a structure to that of an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom oscillator, are well-established tools in the performance-based earthquake engineering paradigm. Initially, such procedures made recourse to inelastic spectra derived for simple elastic–plastic bilinear oscillators, but the request for demand estimates that delve deeper into the inelastic range, motivated investigating the seismic demand of oscillators with more complex backbone curves. Meanwhile, near-source (NS) pulse-like ground motions have been receiving increased attention, because they can induce a distinctive type of inelastic demand. Pulse-like NS ground motions are usually the result of rupture directivity, where seismic waves generated at different points along the rupture front arrive at a site at the same time, leading to a double-sided velocity pulse, which delivers most of the seismic energy. Recent research has led to a methodology for incorporating this NS effect in the implementation of nonlinear static procedures. Both of the previously mentioned lines of research motivate the present study on the ductility demands imposed by pulse-like NS ground motions on oscillators that feature pinching hysteretic behaviour with trilinear backbone curves. Incremental dynamic analysis is used considering 130 pulse-like-identified ground motions. Median, 16% and 84% fractile incremental dynamic analysis curves are calculated and fitted by an analytical model. Least-squares estimates are obtained for the model parameters, which importantly include pulse period Tp. The resulting equations effectively constitute an R − μ − T − Tp relation for pulse-like NS motions. Potential applications of this result towards estimation of NS seismic demand are also briefly discussed. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports on the development of a parallel numerical methodology for simulating large-scale earthquake-induced ground motion in highly heterogeneous basins. We target large sedimentary basins with contrasts in wavelengths of over an order of magnitude. Regular grid methods prove intractable for such problems. We overcome the problem of multiple physical scales by using unstructured finite elements on locally-resolved Delaunay triangulations derived from octree-based grids. The extremely large mesh sizes require special mesh generation techniques. Despite the method's multiresolution capability, large problem sizes necessitate the use of distributed memory parallel supercomputers to solve the elastic wave propagation problem. We have developed a system that helps automate the task of writing efficient portable unstructured mesh solvers for distributed memory parallel supercomputers. The numerical methodology and software system have been used to simulate the seismic response of the San Fernando Valley in Southern California to an aftershock of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. We report on parallel performance on the Cray T3D for several models of the basin ranging in size from 35 000 to 77 million tetrahedra. The results indicate that, despite the highly irregular structure of the problem, excellent performance and scalability are achieved.},

Seismograms computed at the surface of a soft basin for SH waves vertically incident are compared with results obtained by finite difference, finite element, and asymptotic ray theory methods. The method is then applied to a study of the seismic response of sediment-filled valleys to incident SH waves. Various geometries and rheological parameters are considered. The study shows the important role played by the nonplanar interface, which, when the incident wavelengths are comparable to the depth of the valley, results in the generation of Love waves which may have much larger amplitude than the disturbance associated with the direct incident signal. In the presence of a high-velocity contrast between the sediments and the underlying bedrock, these local surface waves can be reflected several times at the edges of the valley, resulting in a long duration of the ground shaking in the basin. In the case of a lower impedance contrast, these waves may produce disturbances on the outer sides of the valley.},

  Abstract                 = {One approach to the numerical solution of a wave equation on an unbounded domain uses a bounded domain surrounded by an absorbing boundary or layer that absorbs waves propagating outwards from the bounded domain. A perfectly matched layer (PML) is an unphysical absorbing layer model for linear wave equations that absorbs, almost perfectly, outgoing waves of all non-tangential angles-of-incidence and of all non-zero frequencies. This paper develops the PML concept for time-harmonic elastodynamics in Cartesian coordinates, utilising insights obtained with electromagnetics PMLs, and presents a novel displacement-based, symmetric finite-element implementation of the PML for time-harmonic plane-strain or three-dimensional motion. The PML concept is illustrated through the example of a one-dimensional rod on elastic foundation and through the anti-plane motion of a two-dimensional continuum. The concept is explored in detail through analytical and numerical results from a PML model of the semi-infinite rod on elastic foundation, and through numerical results for the anti-plane motion of a semi-infinite layer on a rigid base. Numerical results are presented for the classical soil-structure interaction problems of a rigid strip-footing on a (i) half-plane, (ii) layer on a half-plane, and (iii) layer on a rigid base. The analytical and numerical results obtained for these canonical problems demonstrate the high accuracy achievable by PML models even with small bounded domains. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {We performed an assessment of a database of synthetic ground motion generated by a suite of dynamic rupture simulations to verify compatibility of the peak ground amplitudes with respect to empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs). The dynamic rupture model database, developed by Dalguer and Mai (2011), is composed of 360 earthquake scenarios with moment magnitudes in the range of 5.5{\textendash}7, for three mechanisms of faulting (reverse, normal, and strike slip) and for both buried faults and surface rupturing faults, having depth- and non-depth-dependent normal stresses. Initial shear-stress distribution follows a von Karman stochastic distribution. Overall, we show quantitatively that the upper frequency limit of the suite of simulations is 1.0~Hz. Up to this frequency, the synthetic data are compatible with the empirical model, which means that the residuals (defined as the differences between observed and predicted ground motions) fall in the range of {\textpm}σ of the empirical GMPE. Characteristics of the mean values along distance (10{\textendash}45~km) and period T>=1.0 s, including standard deviation of the synthetic response spectra and peak ground velocity, are comparable to their counterpart empirical GMPE. At very near source (\&lt;1{\textendash}2 km), synthetics show supersaturation of the mean peak values, which is different from the saturation features predicted by the GMPEs. The effect of source parameters (such as stress drop, peak slip velocity, and rupture speed) and of surface and buried rupture, as well as hanging wall and footwall, are highly sensitive to ground motion, suggesting that these effects contribute to the variability of ground motion near the source and that inclusion of them in the source terms may contribute to reducing uncertainties in GMPEs.},

  Abstract                 = {The high-frequency seismic field near the epicenter of a large earthquake is modeled by subdividing the fault plane into subelements and summing their contributions at the observation point. Each element is treated as a point source with an ω2 spectral shape, where ω is the angular frequency. Ground-motion contributions from the subsources are calculated using a stochastic model. Attenuation is based on simple geometric spreading in a whole space, coupled with regional anelastic attenuation (Q operator). The form of the ωn spectrum with natural n follows from point shear-dislocation theory with an appropriately chosen slip time function. The seismic moment and corner frequency are the two parameters defining the point-source spectrum and must be linked to the subfault size to make the method complete. Two coefficients, Δσ and K, provide this link. Assigning a moment to a subfault of specified size introduces the stress parameter, Δσ. The relationship between corner frequency (dislocation growth rate) and fault size is established through the coefficient K, which is inherently nonunique. These two parameters control the number of subsources and the amplitudes of high-frequency radiation, respectively. Derivation of the model from shear-dislocation theory reveals the unavoidable uncertainty in assigning ωn spectrum to faults with finite size. This uncertainty can only be reduced through empirical validation. The method is verified by simulating data recorded on rock sites near epicenters of the M8.0 1985 Michoacan (Mexico), the M8.0 1985 Valpara{\'\i}so (Chile), and the M5.8 1988 Saguenay (Qu{\'e}bec) earthquakes. Each of these events is among the largest for which strong-motion records are available, in their respective tectonic environments. The simulations for the first two earthquakes are compared to the more detailed modeling of Somerville et al. (1991), which employs an empirical source function and represents the effects of crustal structure using the theoretical impulse response. Both methods predict the observations accurately on average. The precision of the methods is also approximately equal; the predicted acceleration amplitudes in our model are generally within 15\% of observations. An unexpected result of this study is that a single value of a parameter K provides a good fit to the data at high frequencies for all three earthquakes, despite their different tectonic environments. This suggests a simplicity in the modeling of source processes that was unanticipated.},

  Abstract                 = {Geotechnical models consistently indicate that the stress-strain relation- ship of soils is nonlinear and hysteretic, especially at shear strains larger than -10- 5 to 10 .4 . Nonlinear effects, such as an increase in damping and reduction in shear- wave velocity as excitation strength increases, are commonly recognized in the dy- namic loading of soils. On the other hand, these effects are usually ignored in seis- mological models of ground-motion prediction because of the lack of compelling corroborative evidence from strong-motion observations. The situation is being changed by recently obtained data. Explicit evidence of strong-motion deamplifica- tion, accompanied by changes in resonant frequencies, are found in the data from the 1985 Michoacan, Mexico, and the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquakes, the events recorded by the vertical and surface accelerograph arrays in Taiwan, as well as a number of other events throughout the world. Evidence of nonlinear be- havior becomes apparent beyond a threshold acceleration of -100 to 200 gal. Non- linearity is considerable in cohesionless soil but may be negligible in stiff soils. The findings of recent years indicate that nonlinear site effects are more common than previously recognized in strong-motion seismology.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Tohoku earthquake and associated tsunami in March 2011 caused a severe nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, where level 7 (International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) – INES scale) meltdown at three reactors occurred. The underestimation of the seismic and tsunami hazards has been recognized and the seismic margins assessment of the nuclear plants remains a priority for the whole nuclear community. In this framework a five-year research project called SINAPS@ (Earthquake and Nuclear Installations: Ensuring and Sustaining Safety) is currently on-going in France. A reliable estimate of seismic margins is possible only if all uncertainties, epistemic and aleatory, are effectively identified, quantified and integrated in the seismic risk analysis. SINAPS@ brings together a multidisciplinary community of researchers and engineers from the academic and the nuclear world. SINAPS@ aims at exploring the uncertainties associated to databases, physical processes and methods used at each stage of seismic hazard, site effects, soil and structure interaction, structural and nuclear components vulnerability assessments, in a safety approach: the main objective is ultimately to identify the sources of potential seismic margins resulting from assumptions or when selecting the seismic design level or the design strategy. The whole project is built around an “integrating” work package enabling to test state-of-the-art practices and to challenge new methodologies for seismic risk assessment: the real case of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Japanese nuclear plant, shocked by the severe earthquake in 2007 provided a rich dataset which will be used to compare with the predictions. The present paper proposes for each step of the seismic risk analysis a review of the state of practice in France in the nuclear field and then precise the objectives and research strategy of SINAPS@ to overcome identified limitations or weaknesses. Scientific issues are illustrated through preliminary results of the project.},

As a consequence, dynamic structural analyses with both horizontal ground-motion components become more common, both in research as well as in practice. A review of code provisions regarding selection and scaling of ground motions for bi-directional analysis has, however, revealed that the guidelines provided are frequently inconsistent or are lacking transparency regarding the underlying assumptions. The aim of this study is to shed some light on a number of aspects involved when selecting and scaling records for bi-directional analysis and post-processing results of such analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {The Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) consists of a set of seven downhole strong-motion instruments ranging from 0- to 500-m depth. One of the objectives of this experiment is to estimate site response and study wave propagation as the energy travels from the bedrock underneath the site up through the soil column. The GVDA velocity structure is studied by computing synthetic accelerograms for a small event located at an epicentral distance of 10 km. These synthetics simulate well the data recorded at the borehole stations. In addition, theoretical transfer functions are calculated using the obtained velocity model and compare well with the empirical transfer functions from 54 recorded events. It is also observed that the downgoing wave effect is predominant in the first 87 m and is strongly reduced at depth. Using the velocity structure at GVDA and the transfer function results, it has also been possible to develop a simple method to compute the incident wave field, which is needed in nonlinear site response for instance. Recently there have been many comparative studies between horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratios and traditional spectral ratios. Although many of these studies show that H/V spectral ratios can reproduce the shape of the site response curve, most show differences in the amplitude level. In the case of Garner Valley, where we have both surface and multiple borehole instruments, we find that this discrepancy in amplitude of the site response estimates is because the vertical component has significant site response associated with it due to S-to-P conversions that begin in the weathered granite boundary at 87-m depth.},

  Abstract                 = {For a propagating, vertical, strike-slip fault whose breakage extends to the Earth{\textquoteright}s surface, previous studies by Aki (1968) and Haskell (1969) have suggested that the near-field motions may be similar to those from uniformly-glidingedge dislocations. The theory of these dislocations in uniform motion leads to a simple, convenient relation between the perpendicular and parallel components of motion at the fault{\textquoteright}s surface. A number of examples are considered in order to illustrate this relation between the horizontal components. In general, step-function-like parallel motions result in pulse-like perpendicular displacements. For a given parallel displacement, the amplitude of the pulse depends in a concise manner on ratios of the rupture to shear-wave velocity, and on shear- to compressional-wave velocity. Increasing either of these ratios leads to an increased pulse-amplitude. The dislocation model is applied to the near-field observations of the Parkfield earthquake. The resulting estimate of the total fault offset is within the range of those based on the more detailed models of Aki (1968) and Haskell (1969).},

The functions include constant as well as pressure-dependent elastic shear modulus models, and automatically satisfy the requirement that the elastic response for any loading path be energy conserving. The elastic responses predicted by the hyperelastic model are compared with measured undrained elastic responses of an overconsolidated clay in order to assess, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the predictive capability of the hyperelastic model. The importance of the pressure-dependent nature of the elastic shear modulus is assessed within the context of elastic and plastic responses. An energy-conserving model provides a fundamentally correct description of elastic material behavior even in the regime of plastic responses. },

  Abstract                 = { In the present-day context, man-made sources of ground-borne vibration are rising at a very rapid rate due to increasing construction work, blasting activities, and rapidly expanding rail and road traffic systems. As a consequence, amplified levels of ground-borne vibration occur, causing annoyance to residents living in nearby areas, posing a threat to the stability of old structures, and interfering with instrumentation works in industries. This paper discusses an investigation into the use of trenches as a means of mitigating ground vibration caused by propagation of surface (Rayleigh) waves. Two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) finite-element models were developed using PLAXIS for identifying key factors affecting the vibration isolation efficiency of open and infill trenches. Parametric studies were carried out, and the results were analyzed to arrive at optimum values of geometrical and material properties of trenches. Numerical analysis showed that, for open trenches, normalized depth is the decisive factor and width is of importance in trenches that are very shallow. For infill trenches, it was observed that low-density materials perform exceedingly well as infill materials but their performance is highly sensitive to the relative shear-wave velocity between the infill material and the in situ soil. Finally, an in-depth analysis was carried out to investigate the performance of polyurethane foam trenches in mitigating vibrations caused by harmonic loads. The analysis was extended to study the effectiveness of these geofoam barriers in damping out the vibrations generated by a moving train. In this case, barrier efficiency was shown to increase with increasing train speed. The key findings suggest that trenches are a simple and effective solution for reducing ground-borne vibrations. },

The Green's functions are evaluated by the discrete wave number method, and the boundary conditions yield a linear system of equations. The inversion of this system allows the calculation of the full wave field in the medium.

Choice of this interval is dependent on the length of time desired for the point source response and determines the discretized set of horizontal wavenumbers which contribute to the solution. Comparisons of the results obtained with those derived using the two-dimensional discretization method (Bouchon, 1979) are presented. They show the great accuracy of the two methods.},

Results are shown for common ranges of parameters. Subsequently, the model with an existing parameter data set for Kaolin was used in dynamic finite element calculations and subjected to cyclic loading at different strain levels as well as free vibration. The results were compared with the analytical expression. A comparison was made with experimental data on damping, and another comparison was made with Rayleigh damping, which is commonly used in simple models. From the results it was concluded that HSsmall model has indeed some potential for dynamic applications.However, it does not yet capture material damping at small strain levels (forwhich Rayleigh damping or viscous damping may be added), and it does not include the accumulation of strain (or pore pressure) with multiple load cycles.},

A correct modeling of cyclic elasto-plastic behavior can be exploited in low-cycle fatigue life investigation as well as in manufacturing problems related to springback prediction. The chosen formulation has been proposed by Chaboche, and it is implemented in most of the commercial codes used for nonlinear FEM simulations. At first, a procedure for the proper identification of unknown material model parameters has been put forward. This calibration, based on the data collected from experimental low-cycle fatigue tests, has been performed by means of an inverse method. Laboratory tests differ according to the type of material under investigation. A classification can be operated distinguishing between specimens obtained from bulk materials or from sheet metals. For the former, standard tension-compression tests have been performed, while for the latter, a dedicated testing equipment for three-point bend cyclic tests has been devised. Then, further experimental tests have been run to check model transferability: different strain per cycle amplitudes, asymmetric strain cycling and different stress triaxiality levels have been investigated. For each of these tests, experimental vs. FEM results have been analyzed to show the level of agreement that has been reached.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper explores the GC (Gravouil and Combescure) partitioning strategy recently adopted in real-time testing (RTDS) and pseudo-dynamic testing (PsD) with dynamic substructuring. The GC method is a multi-time step subdomain algorithm able to couple any time integration schemes from the Newmark family with the appropriate time step size dependent on the subdomain. The partitioning method is numerically tested by developing an external software able to couple finite element codes based on implicit and explicit time integration schemes. A complex Finite Element mesh partitioning, exhibiting a large number of interface points, has been considered for a full-size reinforced concrete frame structure subjected to an earthquake loading: the well-known SPEAR structure pseudo-dynamically tested at the ELSA laboratory, in Ispra, Italy. Implicit and explicit parts of the structure are modelled using multi-fibre beam elements whose cross-section is divided into steel and concrete fibres associated with cyclic and nonlinear behaviours. The accuracy of the results from the Explicit/Implicit multi-time step co-computation has been proved by comparing with the results from full explicit and full implicit computations. Despite the very large duration of the earthquake excitation and the number of interface nodes involved into the mesh partitioning, the Explicit/Implicit multi-time step co-computations provide very accurate global (displacements, forces at the base) and local (maximum strains in concrete) results while reducing by a factor 2 the computation times. Finally, it has been observed that the dissipated energy at the interface coming from the GC coupling algorithm remains very low at the end of the earthquake loading, less than 2% of the external energy, for time step ratios between the large and fine time steps ranging from 20 to 200.},

  Abstract                 = {By comparing records of the radial component of motion of teleseismic P waves to records of the vertical component, it is possible to identify S phases within the P wave form. These phases are generated by the mechanism of P to S conversion at discontinuities in velocity under the receiving station. Similar phases of the S to P converted type appear as precursors to the direct SV arrival. Models for the crustal structure can be tested by generating synthetic seismograms for both components of motion of both the P and SV waves and comparing with the data. The technique has been used to model the crustal structure at WWSSN stations CAR and COR. It has also been used to check a recently proposed model for the crustal structure in eastern Canada which contains a large low-shear-velocity zone at the base of the crust. This study indicates that the crustal structure in eastern Canada is highly non-uniform with perhaps few features common to the whole region. Finally, the technique is used to identify several stations in the WWSSN which appear to be located on highly anomalous structure.$\backslash$n},

  Abstract                 = {The generalized linear inverse technique has been adapted to the problem of determining an earthquake source model from body-wave data. The technique has been successfully applied to the Borrego Mountain earthquake of April 9, 1968. Synthetic seismograms computed from the resulting model match in close detail the first 25 sec of long-period seismograms from a wide range of azimuths. The main shock source-time function has been determined by a new simultaneous short period-long period deconvolution technique as well as by the inversion technique. The duration and shape of this time function indicate that most of the body-wave energy was radiated from a surface with effective radius of only 8 km. This is much smaller than the total surface rupture length or the length of the aftershock zone. Along with the moment determination of Mo = 11.2 {\texttimes} 1025 dyne-cm, this radius implies a high stress drop of about 96 bars. Evidence in the amplitude data indicates that the polarization angle of shear waves is very sensitive to lateral structure.},

For this purpose, the concept of test controllability is reinterpreted and mixed stress-strain loading programmes are accounted for. A set of scalar indices, the moduli of instability, related with the inception of an unstable response is introduced and their dependency on the loading programme is explicitly illustrated. The paper shows that the use of these newly defined scalar measures provides support for an alternative definition for mechanical stability, which is closely related with the mathematical notions of existence and uniqueness of the predicted incremental response. In the final section, some mathematical properties of the moduli of instability are discussed, suggesting a novel reinterpretation of other well established theories and providing additional tools for the future application of the proposed framework. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The appropriate Green's functions used are those of a harmonic point foce moving along the axis of the topography in a full space. Obtained reults are compared against those published by other authors. Examples of simulations are presented for different geometries, for different types of incident wave fields, and in particular, for different arrival angles to the topography to quantitatively study three-dimensional effects of the scattering. The accuracy of the results makes it possible to analyze them in both the time and drequency domaisn. Frequency-space representations allow identification of difraction and interference patterns in the seismic response of the topography. Synthetic seismograms are obtained by Fourier analysis. Using timespace domain representations, the nature of each of the scattered waves are identified in terms of, for example, creeping waves and reflected compressional waves.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this paper is to give an upscaling tool valid for the wave equation in general elastic media. This paper is focused on P–SV wave propagation in 2-D, but the methodology can be extended without any theoretical difficulty to the general 3-D case. No assumption on the heterogeneity spectrum is made and the medium can show rapid variations of its elastic properties in all spatial directions. The method used is based on the two-scale homogenization expansion, but extended to the non-periodic case. The scale separation is made using a spatial low-pass filter. The ratio of the filter wavelength cut-off and the minimum wavelength of the propagating wavefield defines a parameter ɛ0 with which the wavefield propagating in the homogenized medium converges to the reference wavefield. In the general case, this non-periodic extension of the homogenization technique is only valid up to the leading order and for the so-called first-order corrector. We apply this non-periodic homogenization procedure to two kinds of heterogeneous media: a randomly generated, highly heterogeneous medium and the Marmousi2 geological model. The method is tested with the Spectral Element Method as a solver to the wave equation. Comparing computations in the homogenized media with those obtained in the original ones shows that convergence with ɛ0 is even better than expected. The effects of the leading order correction to the source and first correction at the receivers' location are shown.},

  Abstract                 = {A Displacement-Based Design (DBD) procedure for bridges equipped with different seismic Isolation Systems (IS's) is proposed. It has been derived from the Direct DBD method recently developed by Priestley and co-workers. The key aspect of the proposed procedure is the definition of a uniform target displacement of the deck, which is assigned by the designer to accomplish a given performance level, expressed through limit values of the maximum IS displacement and of the pier drift, respectively. The proposed design procedure has been developed for four different idealized force-displacement cyclic behaviours of IS's, which can be used to describe the response of a wide variety of IS's, including: (i) Lead-Rubber Bearings (LRB), (ii) High-Damping Rubber Bearings (HDRB), (iii) Friction Pendulum Bearings (FPB), (iv) Combinations of either Low-Damping Rubber Bearings (LDRB) or FPB and Viscous Dampers (VD), (v) Combinations of lubricated Flat Sliding Bearings (FSB) and LDRB, (vi) Combinations of FSB and Steel Yielding Devices (SYD), (vii) Combinations of FSB, Shape Memory Alloy (SMA)-based Re-centring Devices and VD. In the paper, the background and implementation of the design procedure is presented first, then some validation studies through nonlinear time-history analyses on different configurations of continuous deck and multi-span simply supported deck bridges are illustrated.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Based on the asymmetric characteristic of skeleton curve obtained from dynamic tests on soils, a function with double asymptotes is proposed for describing the dynamic constitutive relations of soils. The hysteresis loops observed during unloading and reloading show the same form as the skeleton curve and are constructed by taking the ultimate stress as the corresponding asymptote. The coefficient of initial unloading modulus is used to ensure that the constructed hysteresis loop fits well with the experimental data. Then, a new dynamic constitutive model considering the asymmetry of skeleton curve is elaborated. The verification tests on saturated Nanjing fine sand are performed using a hollow cylinder apparatus to verify the applicability of the \{UD\} model. It is found that the predicted curves by the \{UD\} model agree well with the test data. },

The generalization into the multi-dimensional case is based on the concept of a universal stress\BFstrain curve and the associated effective stress and effective strain. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the generalized models that are conceptually simple and parametrically parsimonious. The generalization method employed also provides a unifying way of extending 1-D hysteretic models to multi-dimensional constitutive models in cyclic plasticity. },

  Abstract                 = {Additive manufacturing (AM) processes involve the fabrication of parts in a layer-wise manner. The layers of material are deposited using a variety of established methodologies, the most popular of which involve either the use of a powerful laser to sinter/melt successive layers of metal/alloy/polymer powders or, the deposition of layers of polymers through a heated extrusion head at a controlled rate. The thermal nature of these processes causes the development of temperature gradients throughout the part and as a result, the part undergoes irregular deformations which ultimately leads to dimensional inaccuracies in the manufactured part. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based methodology is presented in this paper to directly compensate the part geometric design which will help to counter the thermal deformations in the manufactured part. A feed-forward ANN model is trained using backpropagation algorithm to study part deformations resulting from the AM process. The trained network is subsequently employed on the part Stereolithography (STL) file to effect the required geometrical corrections. Two examples are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed compensation methodology. A novel approach to evaluate the conformity of the final part profile to the original part CAD profile has also been developed to quantify the performance of the proposed methodology. The results of the examples show substantial improvement in the part accuracy and thus validate the ANN based geometric compensation approach.},

The inferred rupture model contains two asperities; a small patch near the nucleation and a larger one located 10 divided by 15 km to the south-west. The maximum slip ranges between 2.0 and 2.5 m and the total seismic moment is 1.6 x 10(19) Nm. The inferred rupture history is characterized by rupture acceleration and directivity effects, which are stable features of the inverted models. These features as well as the source-to-receiver geometry are discussed to interpret the high peak ground motions observed ( PGA is 1200 gals) at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant (KKNPP), situated on the hanging-wall of the causative fault. Despite the evident source effects, predicted PGV underestimates the observed values at KKNPP by nearly a factor of 10.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular mechanisms controlling the development of distinct subtypes of neocortical projection neurons, and CNS neuronal diversity more broadly, are only now emerging. We report that the transcription factor SOX5 controls the sequential generation of distinct corticofugal neuron subtypes by preventing premature emergence of normally later-born corticofugal neurons. SOX5 loss-of-function causes striking overlap of the identities of the three principal sequentially born corticofugal neuron subtypes: subplate neurons, corticothalamic neurons, and subcerebral projection neurons. In Sox5(-/-) cortex, subplate neurons aberrantly develop molecular hallmarks and connectivity of subcerebral projection neurons; corticothalamic neurons are imprecisely differentiated, while differentiation of subcerebral projection neurons is accelerated. Gain-of-function analysis reinforces the critical role of SOX5 in controlling the sequential generation of corticofugal neurons-SOX5 overexpression at late stages of corticogenesis causes re-emergence of neurons with corticofugal features. These data indicate that SOX5 controls the timing of critical fate decisions during corticofugal neuron production and thus subtype-specific differentiation and neocortical neuron diversity.},

It covers in particular the fields of soil-structure interaction, ground-borne noise and vibration emitted by transportation systems and wave diffraction by obstacles in an elastic medium. The general setting for a linear bounded structure coupled to an unbounded linear environment through a bounded interface is first recalled, and the domain decomposition technique classically used for its description is put up. Extensions for the cases of nonlinear structure and uncertain environment are then discussed. Finally, the ongoing research in the fields of unbounded interface, moving interface, and multiple interfaces are reviewed and summarized. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The coupling strategy is performed in the Arlequin framework, which is based on a volume coupling and a partition of the energy. A suitable functional space is chosen for the weak enforcement of the continuity between the two models. The choice of this space ensures that the mean of the stochastic solution equals the deterministic solution point-wise, and enforces appropriate boundary conditions on the stochastic dimension. The proof of the existence of the solution of the mixed problem is provided. The numerical strategy is also reviewed, in particular with a view at the Monte Carlo method. Finally, examples show the interest of the method, and possible strategies for use in adaptive modeling. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The example of the Michoacan earthquake shows that a crack type model is better a dislocation model to describe the displacement in the vicinity of the fault. We also show that this in contradiction with the fact that the faulting appears to be a complex process. We attribute this complexity to instabilities in crack growth. The June 28, Landers earthquake offers an exceptional opportunity to apply a new inversion technique to a major strike slip event. We model the rupture evolution including local differences in slip durations and variations in rupture velocity. The slip distribution shows that this event consists of a series of regions of high slip (sub-events) separated by regions of relative low slip. Our inversion favors the hypothesis that the duration of the slip at each point is of the order of the duration of the rupture of each sub-event and is consistent with a crack type process occurring during each sub-event. For such a large earthquake, the slip duration is however smaller than the total rupture duration.},

  Abstract                 = {In the present work, an explicit finite element approach to the solution of the Lagrangian formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for weakly compressible fluids or fluid-like materials is investigated. The introduction of a small amount of compressibility is shown to allow for the formulation of a fast and robust explicit solver based on a particle finite element method. Newtonian and Non-Newtonian Bingham laws are considered. A barotropic equation of state completes the model relating pressure and density fields. The approach has been validated through comparison with experimental tests and numerical simulations of free surface fluid problems involving water and water--soil mixtures.},

  Abstract                 = {Waveforms emerging from correlations of long seismic noise records are extensively used to investigate the crustal and upper-mantle structure of the Earth. To remove the non-stationary events that inevitably lie in seismic records, the so-called one-bit normalization is commonly applied to the noise data. This processing consists of replacing each sample of a record by its sign. Although it is a strong non-linear operation, it preserves the phase of the signal emerging from correlation. Some recent studies show that information can also be extracted from the amplitude of such correlations. In this paper, we develop a theory to understand these non-intuitive results. A statistical approach is used to get an expression of the one-bit noise correlation. This expression involves the standard deviations of coherent and incoherent noise. These two kinds of noise are precisely defined, and explicit expressions of their standard deviations are given in the case of a uniform distribution of noise sources generating surface waves on a layered half-space. In this case, we show that the one-bit noise correlation has the same phase and relative amplitude as the raw noise correlation. This is true in both elastic and anelastic media. Numerical simulations are performed to support our theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Homogenization of earthquake catalog being a pre-requisite for seismic hazard assessment requires region based magnitude conversion relationships. Linear Standard Regression (SR) relations fail when both the magnitudes have measurement errors. To accomplish homogenization, techniques like Orthogonal Standard Regression (OSR) are thus used. In this paper a technique is proposed for using such OSR for preparation of homogenized earthquake catalog in moment magnitude Mw. For derivation of orthogonal regression relation between mb and Mw, a data set consisting of 171 events with observed body wave magnitudes (mb,obs) and moment magnitude (Mw,obs) values has been taken from ISC and GCMT databases for Northeast India and adjoining region for the period 1978–2006. Firstly, an OSR relation given below has been developed using mb,obs and Mw,obs values corresponding to 150 events from this data set. Mw=1.3(±0.004)mb,proxy-1.4(±0.130), where mb,proxy are body wave magnitude values of the points on the OSR line given by the orthogonality criterion, for observed (mb,obs, Mw,obs) points. A linear relation is then developed between these 150 mb,obs values and corresponding mb,proxy values given by the OSR line using orthogonality criterion. The relation obtained is mb,proxy=0.878(±0.03)mb,obs+0.653(±0.15). The accuracy of the above procedure has been checked with the rest of the data i.e., 21 events values. The improvement in the correlation coefficient value between mb,obs and Mw estimated using the proposed procedure compared to the correlation coefficient value between mb,obs and Mw,obs shows the advantage of OSR relationship for homogenization. The OSR procedure developed in this study can be used to homogenize any catalog containing various magnitudes (e.g., ML, mb, MS) with measurement errors, by their conversion to unified moment magnitude Mw. The proposed procedure also remains valid in case the magnitudes have measurement errors of different orders, i.e. the error variance ratio is different from unity.},

  Abstract                 = {Shear cracks with finite cohesive forces can propagate by skipping past barriers. The barriers left behind may remain unbroken or may eventually break because of subsequent increase in dynamic stress depending on the ratio of barrier strength to tectonic stress. This model can explain a variety of observations on rupture in the earth, including (1) segmentation of the fault or ruptured zone in earthquakes and rock bursts, (2) ripples in seismograms which cannot be explained by path effect, and (3) departure of the scaling law of the seismic spectrum from that based upon the similarity assumption. The model also explains why the simple uniform dislocation model sometimes works better than the crack model without barriers. It also predicts, contrary to common belief, that an earthquake with low average stress drop may generate relatively greater amounts of high-frequency waves than an earthquake with high average stress drop. One important consequence of our barrier model is the possibility of predicting the occurrence of aftershocks by analyzing the source spectrum of the main shock.},

First, the approach of Liu and Archuleta (2006) is successfully implemented in an explicit SEM, then, it is shown that the SEM code displays excellent goodness of fits (GOFs) with five Gauss{\textendash}Lobatto{\textendash}Legendre (GLL) nodes per wavelength at 7 Hz. A parametric study on the influence of the number of GLL nodes per wavelength shows that more than five GLL nodes per minimum wavelength do not significantly increase the accuracy; however, a decrease of the accuracy starts to be seen from four GLL nodes. A parametric study of the influence of the number of relaxation mechanism on the accuracy of the numerical response shows that, for this specific case, six to eight relaxation mechanisms are sufficient to reproduce the reference solution, whereas below six the viscoelastic response is strongly affected and tends to an elastic response when using two relaxation mechanisms only.},

  Abstract                 = {Interpretation of P/S-wave successions is used in induced or passive microseismicity. It makes the location of microseismic events possible when the triangulation technique cannot be used. To improve the reliability of the method, we propose a technique that identifies the P/S-wave successions among recorded wave successions. A polarization software is used to verify the orthogonality between the P and S polarization axes. The polarization parameters are computed all along the 3-component acoustic signal. Then the algorithm detects time windows within which the signal polarization axis is perpendicular to the polarization axis of the wave in the reference time window (representative of the P wave). The technique is demonstrated for a synthetic event, and three application cases are presented. The first one corresponds to a calibration shot within which the arrivals of perpendicularly polarized waves are correctly detected in spite of their moderate amplitude. The second example presents a microseismic event recorded during gas withdrawal from an underground gas storage reservoir. The last example is chosen as a counter-example, concerning a microseismic event recorded during a hydraulic fracturing job. The detection algorithm reveals that, in this case, the wave succession does not correspond to a P/S one. This implies that such an event must not be located by the method based on the interpretation of a P/S-wave succession as no such a succession is confirmed.},

A multilinear model is developed to represent the backbone curve of the nonlinear moment-rotation behavior. In addition, a new empirical relationship is proposed that correlates the initial rotational stiffness to the moment capacity of a rocking foundation; this correlation is proposed as an alternative to calculation of stiffness based upon elasticity theory. In the proposed design procedure, a bridge system consisting of a deck mass, a rocking foundation, and a damped elastic column is integrated into a single element from which the equivalent linear damping and period can be determined. The DDBD methodology uses the equivalent system damping and period along with a design displacement response spectrum to determine the seismic displacement demand. The approach is checked by comparing displacements predicted by this method to th...},

The induced vibrations may disturb occupants or damage surrounding buildings. The accelerations generated by the shaking table are used as inputs. The reaction mass and the surrounding soil are modelled using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The natural frequencies were validated experimentally in order to determine the optimum model soil extent. Twenty-one measurements at equal distances from the source were retrieved from the results of the numerical analysis to feed a database with outputs (targets) for a back-propagation feed-forward neural. First, an initial architecture with 2 inputs reached .87 as correlation factor for signal prediction and a maximal error of 17\% for peaks prediction. In order to improve the ANN model, a synchronisation of the input–output signals has been proposed using the cross-correlation product to determine the offset. Further enhancement of the ANN has been achieved by introducing 5 time delays before and after each signal time step. The resulting ANN with 12 inputs reached almost 100\% correlation and less than 2\% error for the peaks prediction. },

The procedure can be used to evolve one or more models for a material by using appropriate laboratory test results. One of the functions showing invariance at ultimate and a single function to describe continuous yield and ultimate yield behavior is investigated in detail. Based on comprehensive series of bests on cubical specimens for different (geological) materials, a hardening or growth function is defined in terms of the trajectory of plastic strain and the ratio of deviatoric to total plastic strain. The predictions of the proposed model are verified with respect to the observed results from tests with different stress paths. The model provides highly satisfactory predictions for both stress?strain and volumetric strain responses from various stress paths. The proposed model shows potential for incorporating other characteristics such as nonassociative rule, pore water pressure effect, and induced anisotropy. },

  Abstract                 = {A hierarchical concept is proposed for the development of constitutive models to account for various factors that influence behaviour of (geologic) materials. It permits evolution of models of progressively higher grades from the basic model representing isotropic hardening with associative behaviour. Factors such as non-associativeness and induced anisotropy due to friction and cyclic loading, and softening are introduced as corrections or perturbations to the basic model. The influence of these factors is captured through non-associativeness manifested by deviation from normality of the plastic strain increments to the yield surface, F. Details of four models: isotropic hardening with associative behaviour, isotropic hardening with non-associative behavioural anisotropic hardening and strain-softening with a damage variable are presented. They are verified with respect to laboratory multiaxial test data under various paths of loading, unloading and reloading for typical soils, rock and concrete. The proposed concept is general, yet sufficiently simplified in terms of physical understanding, number of constants and their physical meanings, determination of the constants and implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the seismic response of a nfinitely long slopes is numerically analysed via the formulation of a 1D analytical/numerical model, in which the soil mechanical behaviour is assumed to be elasto-perfectly viscoplastic and simple shear (SS) kinematical constraints are imposed. In order to simplify the problem, a theoretically based procedure to set up a fully 1D shear constitutive model is defined, within which the mechanical response of a multiaxial relationship is condensed. The use of a 1D shear constitutive model is aimed at reducing the number of unknowns and, therefore, the computational costs. In particular, the case of the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion is considered, while an enhanced Taylor-Galerkin finite element algorithm is employed to simulate the seismic wave propagation within the soil stratum.
The proposed a condensation/calibration procedure captures both the pseudo-hardening pre-failure behaviour and the influence of dilation on the occurrence of strain-localization, which characterize, under SS conditions, the static response of virgin perfectly plastic soils. The effectiveness of the conceived method is shown with reference to freshly deposited deposits, while, in the case of highly overconsolidated strata, some difficulties arise because of the brittle behaviour induced both by unloading and non-associativeness.},

To highlight the non-linear mechanical response of shallow footings, several experimental test results are reviewed and the so-called a macro-element theory is introduced as a promising interpretative and simulation tool. Various macro-element approaches are discussed and their employment for seismic design is exemplified by means of some engineering applications.},

The reinforcement system is mainly composed of wire meshes, geosynthetics, bars/ties, and spike steel plates. This is usually employed for stabilising potentially unstable slopes. The punching process that can occur locally is described by considering the complex interaction mechanisms arising among the different system elements and the soil. For the sake of simplicity, the soil stratum and the anchor are assumed to be horizontal and vertical, respectively. A simplified displacement-based approach is introduced with the main goal of evaluating both the maximum force that can be applied on the anchor and the correlated penetration of the spike plate within the soil. The approach is validated by means of experimental laboratory test results already available in the literature. Finally, in order to stress the role of the spike plates' spacing and the soil stiffness in influencing the mechanical response of the system, the numerical results of parametric analyses are discussed.

  Abstract                 = {This paper has two objectives: to connect directly radiation damping and 1D elastic wave propagation, and to create a simple teaching tool to introduce the subject to students and engineers trained in Structural Dynamics. The first objective is achieved by obtaining the equivalent radiation modal damping using time domain solutions for the fundamental mode in shear of an elastic layer (soil) on flexible rock, for the case in which the rock-soil Impedance Ratio in shear, I=(??rVr)/(??sVs)>1, where ??=mass density and V=shear wave velocity. These time domain solutions are developed for the case of steady-state input sinusoidal shear waves propagating vertically in the rock as well as for horizontal free vibration of the layer. Both derivations result in the same approximate expression for the modal radiation damping in the first mode, ??r1???2/(??I), which is in turn identical to the approximate equation obtained by Roesset and Whitman [11] using a frequency domain approach. This expression for ??r1 is linked to the fact that, during free vibration, the ratio between two successive positive displacement peaks uso and us1 at the ground surface is us0/us1=[(1+I)/(1-I)]2, associated with two wave reflections at the soil-rock interface. From this ratio, and after applying the standard expression to obtain modal damping from damped free vibration, the same expression for ??r1 is reached again, ??r1???[1/(2??)] ln(us0/us1)???[1/(2??)] ln[(1+I)/(1-I)]2???2/(??I). This finding allows development of the simple teaching tool proposed at the end of the paper. While only a crude approximation lacking in rigor, this teaching tool is physically intuitive, links directly wave propagation and modal damping in a simple way and gives the correct result. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = { Adding periodicity to structures leads to wavemode interaction, which generates pass- and stop-bands. The frequencies at which stop-bands occur are related to the periodic nature of the structure. Thus structural periodicity can be shaped in order to design vibro-acoustic filters for reducing vibration and noise transmission. The aim of this paper is to investigate, numerically and experimentally, stop-bands in periodic one-dimensional structures. Two methods for predicting stop-bands are described: the first method applies to infinite periodic structures using a wave approach; the second method deals with the evaluation of a vibration level difference (VLD) in a finite periodic structure embedded within an infinite one-dimensional waveguide. This VLD is defined to predict the performance in terms of noise and vibration insulation of periodic cells embedded in an otherwise uniform structure. Numerical examples are presented, and results are discussed and validated experimentally. Very good agreement between the numerical and experimental models in terms of stop-bands is shown. In particular, the results show that the stop-bands obtained using a wave approach (applied to a single cell of the structure) predict those obtained from the VLD of the corresponding finite periodic structure. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a new numerical method to solve the heterogeneous elastic wave equations formulated as a linear hyperbolic system using first-order derivatives with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on 3-D unstructured tetrahedral meshes. The method combines the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element (FE) method with the ADER approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives for flux calculation. In the DG framework, in contrast to classical FE methods, the numerical solution is approximated by piecewise polynomials which allow for discontinuities at element interfaces. Therefore, the well-established theory of numerical fluxes across element interfaces obtained by the solution of Riemann-Problems can be applied as in the finite volume framework. To define a suitable flux over the element surfaces, we solve so-called Generalized Riemann-Problems (GRP) at the element interfaces. The GRP solution provides simultaneously a numerical flux function as well as a time-integration method. The main idea is a Taylor expansion in time in which all time-derivatives are replaced by space derivatives using the so-called Cauchy–Kovalewski or Lax–Wendroff procedure which makes extensive use of the governing PDE. The numerical solution can thus be advanced for one time step without intermediate stages as typical, for example, for classical Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes. Due to the ADER time-integration technique, the same approximation order in space and time is achieved automatically. Furthermore, the projection of the tetrahedral elements in physical space on to a canonical reference tetrahedron allows for an efficient implementation, as many computations of 3-D integrals can be carried out analytically beforehand. Based on a numerical convergence analysis, we demonstrate that the new schemes provide very high order accuracy even on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and computational cost and storage space for a desired accuracy can be reduced by higher-order schemes. Moreover, due to the choice of the basis functions for the piecewise polynomial approximation, the new ADER–DG method shows spectral convergence on tetrahedral meshes. An application of the new method to a well-acknowledged test case and comparisons with analytical and reference solutions, obtained by different well-established methods, confirm the performance of the proposed method. Therefore, the development of the highly accurate ADER–DG approach for tetrahedral meshes provides a numerical technique to approach 3-D wave propagation problems in complex geometry with unforeseen accuracy.},

This volume-shear coupling mechanism results in phases of significant regain in soil shear stiffness and strength, and limits the magnitude of cyclic shear deformations. Motivated by experimental observations, a plasticity model is developed for capturing the characteristics of cyclic mobility. This model extends an existing multi-surface plasticity formulation with newly developed flow and hardening rules. The new flow rule allows for reproducing cyclic shear strain accumulation, and the subsequent dilative phases observed in liquefied soil response. The new hardening rule enhances numerical robustness and efficiency. A model calibration procedure is outlined, based on monotonic and cyclic laboratory sample test data. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Because of the presence of the surrounding material stresses will be present both inside and outside the region. The resulting elastic field may be found very simply with the help of a sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations. In particular, if the region is an ellipsoid the strain inside it is uniform and may be expressed in terms of tabulated elliptic integrals. In this case a further problem may be solved. An ellipsoidal region in an infinite medium has elastic constants different from those of the rest of the material; how does the presence of this inhomogeneity disturb an applied stress-field uniform at large distances? It is shown that to answer several questions of physical or engineering interest it is necessary to know only the relatively simple elastic field inside the ellipsoid.},

  Abstract                 = {A modal computation of a complete clarinet is presented by the association of finite-element models of the reed and of part of the pipe with a lumped-element model of the rest of the pipe. In the first part, we compare modal computations of the reed and the air inside the mouthpiece and barrel with measurements performed by holographic interferometry. In the second part, the complete clarinet is modeled by adjoining a series of lumped elements for the remaining part of the pipe. The parameters of the lumped-resonator model are determined from acoustic impedance measurements. Computed eigenmodes of the whole system show that modal patterns of the reed differ significantly whether it is alone or coupled to air. Some modes exhibit mostly reed motion and a small contribution of the acoustic pressure inside the pipe. Resonance frequencies measured on a clarinet with the mouthpiece replaced by the cylinder of equal volume differ significantly from the computed eigenfrequencies of the clarinet taking the actual shape of the mouthpiece into account and from those including the (linear) dynamics of the reed. This suggests revisiting the customary quality index based on the alignment of the peaks of the input acoustical impedance curve.},

  Abstract                 = {The majority of crustal faults host earthquakes when the ratio of average background shear stress ?b to effective normal stress ?eff is ?b/?eff?0.6. In contrast, mature plate-boundary faults like the San Andreas Fault (SAF) operate at ?b/?eff?0.2. Dynamic weakening, the dramatic reduction in frictional resistance at coseismic slip velocities that is commonly observed in laboratory experiments, provides a leading explanation for low stress levels on mature faults. Strongly velocity-weakening friction laws permit rupture propagation on flat faults above a critical stress level ?pulse/?eff?0.25. Provided that dynamic weakening is not restricted to mature faults, the higher stress levels on most faults are puzzling. In this work, we present a self-consistent explanation for the relatively high stress levels on immature faults that is compatible with low coseismic frictional resistance, from dynamic weakening, for all faults. We appeal to differences in structural complexity with the premise that geometric irregularities introduce resistance to slip in addition to frictional resistance. This general idea is quantified for the special case of self-similar fractal roughness of the fault surface. Natural faults have roughness characterized by amplitude-to-wavelength ratios ? between 10?3 and 10?2. Through a second-order boundary perturbation analysis of quasi-static frictionless sliding across a band-limited self-similar interface in an ideally elastic solid, we demonstrate that roughness induces an additional shear resistance to slip, or roughness drag, given by ?drag=8?3?2G??/?min, for G?=G/(1??) with shear modulus Gand Poisson's ratio ?, slip ?, and minimum roughness wavelength ?min. The influence of roughness drag on fault mechanics is verified through an extensive set of dynamic rupture simulations of earthquakes on strongly rate-weakening fractal faults with elastic-plastic off-fault response. The simulations suggest that fault rupture, in the form of self-healing slip pulses, becomes probable above a background stress level ?b??pulse+?drag. For the smoothest faults (??10?3), ?drag is negligible compared to frictional resistance, so that ?b??pulse?0.25?eff. However, on rougher faults (??10?2), roughness drag can exceed frictional resistance. We expect that ?drag ultimately departs from the predicted scaling when roughness-induced stress perturbations activate pervasive off-fault inelastic deformation, such that background stress saturates at a limit (?b?0.6?eff) determined by the finite strength of the off-fault material. We speculate that this strength, and not the much smaller dynamically weakened frictional strength, determines the stress levels at which the majority of faults operate.},

  Abstract                 = {We are concerned with high-fidelity subsurface imaging of the soil, which commonly arises in geotechnical site characterization and geophysical explorations. Specifically, we attempt to image the spatial distribution of the Lamé parameters in semi-infinite, three-dimensional, arbitrarily heterogeneous formations, using surficial measurements of the soil's response to probing elastic waves. We use the complete waveform response of the medium to drive the inverse problem, by using a partial-differential-equation (PDE)-constrained optimization approach, directly in the time-domain, to minimize the misfit between the observed response of the medium at select measurement locations, and a computed response corresponding to a trial distribution of the Lamé parameters. We discuss strategies that lend algorithmic robustness to our proposed inversion scheme. To limit the computational domain to the size of interest, we employ perfectly-matched-layers (PMLs).In order to resolve the forward problem, we use a recently developed hybrid finite element approach, where a displacement-stress formulation for the PML is coupled to a standard displacement-only formulation for the interior domain, thus leading to a computationally cost-efficient scheme. Time-integration is accomplished by using an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, which is well-suited for large-scale problems on parallel computers.We verify the accuracy of the material gradients obtained via our proposed scheme, and report numerical results demonstrating successful reconstruction of the two Lamé parameters for both smooth and sharp profiles.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess site-specific ground motion it is common practice to calculate seismic hazard at bedrock and then multiply it by a deterministic site-amplification factor typically computed from 1D numerical simulation. For this reason, the ground motion at bedrock should be free from amplification phenomena and its site response flat. Ground Motion Prediction Equations are generally calibrated using records at stations classified as rock that, however, can be affected by site-effects, caused by peculiar morphological/stratigraphic features.
In this work, we propose six proxies based on geological, topographical and geophysical data to identify reference rock sites. We apply these proxies to the same set of recording stations used to derive the most recent ground-motion attenuation model for Italy [6] - ITA10. We find that about half of the analyzed sites, classified as rock on the basis of VS,30 or geological conditions, are unaffected by amplifications and can be actually considered as reference rock sites.
Then, we re-calibrate the ITA10 prediction equations for horizontal peak ground acceleration at 20 spectral ordinates in the period range 0.04-2 s, accounting for sites that we identify as references rock sites. The resulting reference median values are, on average, 35-40% lower than those calculated by Bindi et al. (2011) model for rock sites. Conversely, the ground motion variability is not significantly changed, even if we introduce a new site soil category to describe the reference rock stations.},

Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, non-linear and expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that can be used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial design optimization problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty has its roots in both the Bayesian and the multi-objective optimization literatures. More specifically, an extended domination rule is used to handle objectives and constraints in a unified way, and a corresponding expected hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion is proposed. This new criterion is naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteria---the classical Expected Improvement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective extensions---as soon as at least one feasible point is available. The calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequential Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset simulation method, which is well known in the field of structural reliability, is used to estimate the criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimization), is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for single- and multi-objective constrained optimization.},

  Abstract                 = {Random walk particle tracking methodologies to simulate solute transport of conservative species constitute an attractive alternative for their computational efficiency and absence of numerical dispersion. Yet, problems stemming from the reconstruction of concentrations from particle distributions have typically prevented its use in reactive transport problems. The numerical problem mainly arises from the need to first reconstruct the concentrations of species/components from a discrete number of particles, which is an error prone process, and then computing a spatial functional of the concentrations and/or its derivatives (either spatial or temporal). Errors are then propagated, so that common strategies to reconstruct this functional require an unfeasible amount of particles when dealing with nonlinear reactive transport problems. In this context, this article presents a methodology to directly reconstruct this functional based on kernel density estimators. The methodology mitigates the error propagation in the evaluation of the functional by avoiding the prior estimation of the actual concentrations of species. The multivariate kernel associated with the corresponding functional depends on the size of the support volume, which defines the area over which a given particle can influence the functional. The shape of the kernel functions and the size of the support volume determines the degree of smoothing, which is optimized to obtain the best unbiased predictor of the functional using an iterative plug-in support volume selector. We applied the methodology to directly reconstruct the reaction rates of a precipitation/dissolution problem involving the mixing of two different waters carrying two aqueous species in chemical equilibrium and moving through a randomly heterogeneous porous medium.},

  Abstract                 = {Perfectly matched layers (PMLs) provide an exponential decay, independent of the frequency, of any propagating field along an assigned direction without producing spurious reflections at the interface with the elastic volume. For this reason PMLs have been applied as absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) and their efficiency in attenuating outgoing wave fields on the outskirts of numerical grids is more and more recognized. However, PMLs are designed for first-order differential equations and a natural extension to second-order Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) involves either additional variables in the time evolution scheme or convolutional operations. Both techniques are computationally expensive when implemented in a spectral element (SE) code and other ABC's (e.g. paraxial or standard sponge methods) still remain more attractive than PMLs. Here, an efficient second-order imple mentation of PMLs for SE is developed from interpreting the Newmark scheme as a time-staggered velocity-stress algorithm. The discrete equivalence with the standard scheme is based on an L 2 approximation of the stress field, with the same polynomial order as the velocity. In this case, PMLs can be introduced as for first-order equations preserving the natural second-order time stepping. Subsequently, a non-classical frequency-dependent perfectly matched layer is introduced by moving the pole of the stretching along the imaginary axis. In this case, the absorption depends on the frequency and the layer switches from a transparent behaviour at low frequencies to a uniform absorption as the frequency goes to infinity. It turns out to be more efficient than classical PMLs in the absorption of the incident waves, as the grazing incidence approaches, at the cost of a memory variable for any split component. Finally, an extension of PMLs to general curvilinear coordinates is proposed. {\copyright} 2005 RAS.},

  Abstract                 = {Broadband (0.1–20 Hz) synthetic seismograms for finite-fault sources were produced for a model where stress drop is constant with seismic moment to see if they can match the magnitude dependence and distance decay of response spectral amplitudes found in the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) relations recently developed from strong-motion data of crustal earthquakes in tectonically active regions. The broadband synthetics were constructed for earthquakes of M 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5 by combining deterministic synthetics for plane-layered models at low frequencies with stochastic synthetics at high frequencies. The stochastic portion used a source model where the Brune stress drop of 100 bars is constant with seismic moment. The deterministic synthetics were calculated using an average slip velocity, and hence, dynamic stress drop, on the fault that is uniform with magnitude. One novel aspect of this procedure is that the transition frequency between the deterministic and stochastic portions varied with magnitude, so that the transition frequency is inversely related to the rise time of slip on the fault. The spectral accelerations at 0.2, 1.0, and 3.0 sec periods from the synthetics generally agreed with those from the set of NGA relations for M 5.5–7.5 for distances of 2–100 km. At distances of 100–200 km some of the NGA relations for 0.2 sec spectral acceleration were substantially larger than the values of the synthetics for M 7.5 and M 6.5 earthquakes because these relations do not have a term accounting for Q. At 3 and 5 sec periods, the synthetics for M 7.5 earthquakes generally had larger spectral accelerations than the NGA relations, although there was large scatter in the results from the synthetics. The synthetics showed a sag in response spectra at close-in distances for M 5.5 between 0.3 and 0.7 sec that is not predicted from the NGA relations.},

  Abstract                 = {The estimation of well catchments in uniform background flow is usually made by means of models that rely on the assumption of homogeneous and isotropic conductivity fields. Properties of natural systems may vary significantly and in a very complex manner in space. One conceptualisation that takes into account this variability in hydraulic conductivity is based on the theory of random space functions. The effect of this randomness is that the influence of a discharge well cannot be delineated without some degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty needs to be considered when areas of contribution to wells under field conditions are to be defined. In this work, the problem is tackled by dimensional analysis and the solution is numerically treated within a stochastic approach. A steady 2-D non-uniform groundwater flow is considered in a statistically isotropic field of hydraulic conductivity K(x), with a single production well and a uniform base gradient. The analysis is performed via a Monte Carlo procedure that involves the generation of a great number of realisations of a given Y' = In(K/K-G) field, normally distributed, with zero mean, sigma(Y)(2) variance and simple exponential correlation. Various degrees of domain heterogeneity, i.e. sigma(Y)(2), are considered. The probability P-1 that an ideal solute pulse released in a given location in the aquifer reaches the well is, identified, and conceptually consistent equations of practical use for engineering purposes are proposed.},

Such stress must be considered in the evaluation of seismic hazards of nuclear power plants (NPP) and, in particular, for the potential of surface slip (i.e., probabilistic fault displacement hazard analysis - PFDHA) on both primary and distributed faults. In this study, based on the assumption that slip on pre-existing structures can represent the elastic response of compliant fault zones to the permanent co-seismic stress changes induced by other major seismogenic structures, we propose a three-step procedure to address fault displacement issues and consider possible influence of surface faulting/deformation on vibratory ground motion (VGM). This approach includes: (a) data on the presence and characteristics of capable faults, (b) data on recognized and/or modeled co-seismic deformation fields and, where possible, (c) static stress transfer between source and receiving faults of unknown capability. The initial step involves the recognition of the major seismogenic structures nearest to the site and their characterization in terms of maximum expected earthquake and the time frame to be considered for determining their “capability” (as defined in the International Atomic Energy Agency - \{IAEA\} Specific Safety Guide SSG-9). Then a GIS-based buffer approach is applied to identify all the faults near the NPP, possibly influenced by the crustal deformation induced by the major seismogenic structures. Faults inside these areas have to be tested for “capability” according to the same time window defined for the primary seismogenic structures. If fault capability is confirmed or, eventually, cannot be assessed, the next step is to implement an approach based on the potential to affect the safety of the \{NPP\} site in terms of fault geometry, and potential displacement. Finally, in the case where the fault can affect the safety of the site, the third step is the \{PFDHA\} or, in other words, the calculation of the annual probability of exceedance of the potential co-seismic fault displacement; this displacement is to be compared with the fault displacement threshold that will impact the safety of the \{NPP\} site. We also consider the effect of site vicinity tectonism on site vibratory ground motion and discuss an example in the light of the use of the GMPE. },

  Abstract                 = {Although kinematic earthquake source inversions show dominantly pulse‐like subshear rupture behavior, seismological observations, laboratory experiments and theoretical models indicate that earthquakes can operate with different rupture styles: either as pulses or cracks, that propagate at subshear or supershear speeds. The determination of rupture style and speed has important implications for ground motions and may inform about the state of stress and strength of active fault zones. We conduct 2D in‐plane dynamic rupture simulations with a spectral element method to investigate the diversity of rupture styles on faults governed by velocity‐and‐state‐dependent friction with dramatic velocity‐weakening at high slip rate. Our rupture models are governed by uniform initial stresses, and are artificially initiated. We identify the conditions that lead to different rupture styles by investigating the transitions between decaying, steady state and growing pulses, cracks, sub‐shear and super‐shear ruptures as a function of background stress, nucleation size and characteristic velocity at the onset of severe weakening. Our models show that small changes of background stress or nucleation size may lead to dramatic changes of rupture style. We characterize the asymptotic properties of steady state and self‐similar pulses as a function of background stress. We show that an earthquake may not be restricted to a single rupture style, but that complex rupture patterns may emerge that consist of multiple rupture fronts, possibly involving different styles and back‐propagating fronts. We also demonstrate the possibility of a super‐shear transition for pulse‐like ruptures. Finally, we draw connections between our findings and recent seismological observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Large dynamic stresses near earthquake rupture fronts may induce an inelastic response of the surrounding materials, leading to increased energy absorption that may affect dynamic rupture. We systematically investigate the effects of off‐fault plastic energy dissipation in 2‐D in‐plane dynamic rupture simulations under velocity‐and‐state‐dependent friction with severe weakening at high slip velocity. We find that plasticity does not alter the nature of the transitions between different rupture styles (decaying versus growing, pulse‐like versus crack‐like, and subshear versus supershear ruptures) but increases their required background stress and nucleation size. We systematically quantify the effect of amplitude and orientation of background shear stresses on the asymptotic properties of self‐similar pulse‐like ruptures: peak slip rate, rupture speed, healing front speed, slip gradient, and the relative contribution of plastic strain to seismic moment. Peak slip velocity and rupture speed remain bounded. From fracture mechanics arguments, we derive a nonlinear relation between their limiting values, appropriate also for crack‐like and supershear ruptures. At low background stress, plasticity turns self‐similar pulses into steady state pulses, for which plastic strain contributes significantly to the seismic moment. We find that the closeness to failure of the background stress state is an adequate predictor of rupture speed for relatively slow events. Our proposed relations between state of stress and earthquake source properties in the presence of off‐fault plasticity may contribute to the improved interpretation of earthquake observations and to pseudodynamic source modeling for ground motion prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {The effectiveness of structural fuse mechanisms used to improve the performance of buildings during seismic loading depends on their capacity, ductility, energy dissipation, isolation, and self-centering characteristics. Although rocking shallow footings could also be designed to possess many of these desirable characteristics, current civil engineering practice often avoids nonlinear behavior of soil in design, due to the lack of confidence and knowledge about cyclic rocking. Several centrifuge experiments were conducted to study the rocking behavior of shallow footings, supported by sand and clay soil stratums, during slow lateral cyclic loading and dynamic shaking. The ratio of the footing area to the footing contact area required to support the applied vertical loads (A/Ac) , related to the factor of safety with respect to vertical loading, is correlated with moment capacity, energy dissipation, and permanent settlement measured in centrifuge and 1 g model tests. Results show that a footing with large A/Ac ratio (about 10) possesses a moment capacity that is insensitive to soil properties, does not suffer large permanent settlements, has a self-centering characteristic associated with uplift and gap closure, and dissipates seismic energy that corresponds to about 20{\%} damping ratio. Thus, there is promise to use rocking footings in place of, or in combination with, structural base isolation and energy dissipation devices to improve the performance of the structure during seismic loading.

Relatively advanced tools can describe nonlinear soil-foundation behavior, including temporary gap formation, foundation settlement and sliding, and hysteretic energy dissipation. We review two tools that describe such effects for shallow foundations and that are implemented in the computational platform OpenSees: a beam-on-nonlinear- Winkler foundation (BNWF) model and a contact interface model (CIM).We reviewinput parameters and recommend parameter selection protocols. Model performance with the recommended protocols is evaluated through model-to- model comparisons for a hypothetical shear wall building resting on clay and model-data comparisons for several centrifuge test specimens on sand. The models describe generally consistent moment-rotation behavior, although shear-sliding and settlement behaviors deviate depending on the degree of foundation uplift. Pronounced uplift couples the moment and shear responses, often resulting in significant shear sliding and settlements. Such effects can be mitigated through the lateral connection of foundation elements with tie beams.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this paper is to clarify the extent of near-source effects and non-linear soil response that took place at the Japanese nuclear site of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, during the MW 6.6 Niigata-Ken Ch{\={u}}etsu-Oki earthquake (July, 16th 2007). The interest of this case study stems from the relative small source-to-site distance and shallow hypocenter depth, coupled with the consistent seismic record database available from two down-hole arrays of strong motion accelerometers, installed within the nuclear site. Records were processed first to highlight those features related to near-source conditions, such as directivity and polarization, and, subsequently, to identify dependence of site response on the direction of motion and on the non-linear soil behaviour. Moreover, borehole interferometry was used to check the two available velocity profiles (estimated by in situ PS logging) used for 1D linear equivalent numerical simulations. In one case, an improved agreement with the empirical amplification functions was obtained using a smoothed profile. The main non-linear features highlighted by signal processing were globally reproduced by means of linear-equivalent analyses, that pointed out the strong influence of the input motion direction. Among the principal results of this research, it was found that the hanging-wall and directivity effects along with the non-linear site-effects dominate the ground response during the main shock, and that the site amplification features are strongly dependent on the rotation angle of the horizontal components.},

  Abstract                 = {The scope of this paper is to give an insight into the advantages of a new, all-embracing, modeling approach of a strong ground motion scenario, by carrying out a source-to-structure analysis at regional scale, accounting explicitly for the uncertainties related to the databases and the models. To this end, a suitable case-study is represented by the 2007 Mw6.6 Niigata-Ken Chūetsu-Oki seismic sequence (west Japan), that damaged the Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant. This study describes the effect of the wave propagation path within the Earth's crust on the seismic response of nuclear reactor buildings located nearby a seismogenic source. The multiscale problem is de-coupled into three steps: (1) a parallel simulation of seismic-wave propagation throughout the Earth's crust at regional scale (≈ 60 km wide, major 3-D geological interfaces found below the nuclear site), reliable up to 5.0 Hz; (2) a mid hybridization step consisting in enriching the synthetic wave-field at high frequency (up to 30 Hz), employing an Artificial Neural Network to predict the short-period (SP) spectral ordinates; (3) a high-resolution structural dynamic analysis, introducing the hybrid broad-band synthetics as input wave-motion. A simplified stress-test is performed, by simulating two small point-wise aftershocks at different source-site position. The impact of the underground 3-D geology on the structural components is finally quantified, by injecting the obtained broad-band time-histories in a Soil-Structure Interaction (SSI) model of the nuclear reactor building. The good fit obtained in terms of amplification factor at different recording stations assures the high-fidelity of the holistic philosophy endorsed.},

  Abstract                 = {A new paradigm has now emerged in performance-based seismic design of soil-foundation-structure systems. Instead of imposing strict safety limits on forces and moments transmitted from the foundation onto the soil (aiming at avoiding pseudo-static failure), the new dynamic approach {\textquotedblleft}invites{\textquotedblright} the creation of two simultaneous {\textquotedblleft}failure{\textquotedblright} mechanisms: substantial foundation uplifting and ultimate-bearing-capacity slippage, while ensuring that peak and residual deformations are acceptable. The paper shows that allowing the foundation to work at such extreme conditions may not only lead to system collapse, but it would help protect (save) the structure from seismic damage. A potential price to pay: residual settlement and rotation, which could be abated with a number of foundation and soil improvements. Numerical studies and experiments demonstrate that the consequences of such daring foundation design would likely be quite beneficial to bridge piers, building frames, and simple frames retrofitted with a shear wall. It is shown that system collapse could be avoided even under seismic shaking far beyond the design ground motion. Three key phenomena are identified as the prime sources of the success; they are illustrated for a bridge-pier: (i) the constraining of the transmitted accelerations by the reduced ultimate moment capacity of the foundation, to levels of about one-half of those developing in a conventional design; (ii) the beneficial action of the static vertical load of the structure which pushes down to {\textquotedblleft}re-center{\textquotedblright} the leaning (due to uplifting and soil yielding) footing, instead of further distressing the plastic hinge of the column of the conventional design; and (iii) the substantial increase of the fundamental natural period of the system as uplifting takes place, which brings the structure beyond the significant period range of a ground motion, and hence leads to the abatement of its severe shaking.},

Three stages of foundation performance, ranging from the initial elastic fully-bonded response, to the nearly-elastic but nonlinear response with the foundation partially detaching and uplifting from the soil, and finally to the ultimate stage where full mobilization of soil bearing failure mechanisms develop. Simple to use formulas or charts are developed for all stages of response in terms of dimensionless parameters, prominent among which is the static factor of safety against bearing-capacity failure under purely-vertical loading. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We seek to develop methods for the estimation of seafloor statistics that take into account the finite precision, resolution, and sampling obtained by actual echo sounding systems. In this initial paper we restrict our attention to the problem of recovering second-order statistics from data sets collected by multibeam devices such as Sea Beam. The seafloor is modeled as a stationary, zero-mean, Gaussian random field completely specified by its two-point covariance function. We introduce an anisotropic two-point covariance function that has five free parameters describing the amplitude, orientation, characteristic wave numbers, and Hausdorff (fractal) dimension of seafloor topography. We formulate the general forward problem relating this model to the statistics of an ideal multibeam echo sounder, in particular the along-track autocovariance functions of individual beams and the cross-covariance functions between beams of arbitrary separation. Using these second moments as data functionals, we then pose the inverse problem of estimating the seafloor parameters from realistic, noisy data sets with finite sampling and beamwidth, and we solve this inverse problem by an iterative, linearized, least squares method. The inversion method is applied to Sea Beam transit data from both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Sea Beam system noise stands out as a sharp spike on the along-track autocovariance function and can be modeled as a white noise process whose amplitude generally increases with beam angle. The five parameters in our second-order model can be estimated from the inversion of data sets comprising ∼100–200 km of track length. In general, the cross-track wave number is the most poorly determined, although uncertainties in the assumed Sea Beam response may bias the values of the fractal dimension. Using the assumed beamwidth, the measured noise values, and the seafloor parameters recovered from the inversion, we generate Sea Beam “synthetics” whose statistical character can be directly compared with raw Sea Beam data. For most of the track segments we have processed thus far the synthetics are similar to the data. In the case of one Atlantic profile, however, the comparison clearly indicates the necessity of incorporating higher-order statistics. The space domain procedures described in this paper can be extended for this purpose.},

  Abstract                 = {This article provides an overview of the application of the staggered-grid finite-difference technique to model wave propagation problems in 3D elastic media. In addition to presenting generalized, discrete representations of the differential equations of motion using the staggered-grid approach, we also provide detailed formulations that describe the incorporation of moment-tensor sources, the implementation of a stable and accurate representation of a planar free-surface boundary for 3D models, and the derivation and implementation of an approximate technique to model spatially variable anelastic attenuation within time-domain finite-difference computations. The comparison of results obtained using the staggered-grid technique with those obtained using a frequency-wavenumber algorithm shows excellent agreement between the two methods for a variety of models. In addition, this article also introduces a memory optimization procedure that allows large-scale 3D finite-difference problems to be computed on a conventional, single-processor desktop workstation. With this technique, model storage is accommodated using both external (hard-disk) and internal (core) memory. To reduce system overhead, a cascaded time update procedure is utilized to maximize the number of computations performed between I/O operations. This formulation greatly expands the applicability of the 3D finite-difference technique by providing an efficient and practical algorithm for implementation on commonly available workstation platforms.},

The scenarios incorporate a kinematic rupture description with the average rupture speed along the large slip portions of the fault set at 0.96, 0.89, and 0.84 times the local shear wave velocity. Consistent with previous simulations, a southern hypocenter efficiently channels energy into the Los Angeles region along the string of basins south of the San Gabriel Mountains. However, we find the basin ground motion levels are quite sensitive to the prescribed rupture speed, with peak ground velocities at some sites varying by over a factor of two for variations in average rupture speed of about 15%. These results have important implications for estimating seismic hazards in Southern California and emphasize the need for improved understanding of earthquake rupture processes.},

In our approach, fault rupture is represented kinematically and incorporates spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture speed, and rise time. The prescribed slip distribution is constrained to follow an inverse wavenumber-squared fall-off and the average rupture speed is set at 80% of the local shear-wave velocity, which is then adjusted such that the rupture propagates faster in regions of high slip and slower in regions of low slip. We use a Kostrov-like slip-rate function having a rise time proportional to the square root of slip, with the average rise time across the entire fault constrained empirically. Recent observations from large surface rupturing earthquakes indicate a reduction of rupture propagation speed and lengthening of rise time in the near surface, which we model by applying a 70% reduction of the rupture speed and increasing the rise time by a factor of 2 in a zone extending from the surface to a depth of 5 km. We demonstrate the fidelity of the technique by modeling the strong-motion recordings from the Imperial Valley, Loma Prieta, Landers, and Northridge earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {During the Mw 7.1 Hector Mine earthquake, peak ground velocities recorded at sites in the central San Bernardino basin region were up to 2 times larger and had significantly longer durations of strong shaking than sites just outside the basin. To better understand the effects of 3D structure on the long-period ground-motion response in this region, we have performed finite-difference simulations for this earthquake. The simulations are numerically accurate for periods of 2 sec and longer and incorporate the detailed spatial and temporal heterogeneity of source rupture, as well as complex 3D basin structure. Here, we analyze three models of the San Bernardino basin: model A (with structural constraints from gravity and seismic reflection data), model F (water well and seismic refraction data), and the Southern California Earthquake Center version 3 model (hydrologic and seismic refraction data). Models A and F are characterized by a gradual increase in sediment thickness toward the south with an abrupt step-up in the basement surface across the San Jacinto fault. The basin structure in the SCEC version 3 model has a nearly uniform sediment thickness of 1 km with little basement topography along the San Jacinto fault. In models A and F, we impose a layered velocity structure within the sediments based on the seismic refraction data and an assumed depth-dependent Vp/Vs ratio. Sediment velocities within the SCEC version 3 model are given by a smoothly varying rule-based function that is calibrated to the seismic refraction measurements. Due to computational limitations, the minimum shear-wave velocity is fixed at 600 m/sec in all of the models. Ground-motion simulations for both models A and F provide a reasonably good match to the amplitude and waveform characteristics of the recorded motions. In these models, surface waves are generated as energy enters the basin through the gradually sloping northern margin. Due to the basement step along the San Jacinto fault, the surface wave energy is confined to the region north of this structure, consistent with the observations. The SCEC version 3 model, lacking the basin geometry complexity present in the other two models, fails to provide a satisfactory match to the characteristics of the observed motions. Our study demonstrates the importance of using detailed and accurate basin geometry for predicting ground motions and also highlights the utility of integrating geological, geophysical, and seismological observations in the development and validation of 3D velocity models.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method with domain decomposition to solve time-dependent non-linear problems. This method enables arbitrary numeric schemes of the Newmark family to be coupled with different time steps in each subdomain: this coupling is achieved by prescribing continuity of velocities at the interface. We are more specifically interested in the coupling of implicit/explicit numeric schemes taking into account material and geometric non-linearities. The interfaces are modelled using a dual Schur formulation where the Lagrange multipliers represent the interfacial forces. Unlike the continuous formulation, the discretized formulation of the dynamic problem is unable to verify simultaneously the continuity of displacements, velocities and accelerations at the interfaces. We show that, within the framework of the Newmark family of numeric schemes, continuity of velocities at the interfaces enables the definition of an algorithm which is stable for all cases envisaged. To prove this stability, we use an energy method, i.e. a global method over the whole time interval, in order to verify the algorithms properties. Then, we propose to extend this to non-linear situations in the following cases: implicit linear/explicit non-linear, explicit non-linear/explicit non-linear and implicit non-linear/explicit non-linear. Finally, we present some examples showing the feasibility of the method. Copyright {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Research activity in the mechanics of landslides has led to renewed interest in the infinite slope equations, and the need for a more general framework for giving insight into the probability of failure of long slopes involving non-homogeneous vertical soil profiles and variable groundwater conditions. This paper describes a methodology in which parameters such as the soil strength, slope geometry and pore pressures, are generated using random field theory. Within the limitations of the infinite slope assumptions, the paper clearly demonstrates the important " seeking out" effect of failure mechanisms in spatially random materials, and how " first order" methods that may not properly account for spatial variability can lead to unconservative estimates of the probability of slope failure. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A finite element model is developed involving "tied freedoms" that allows analysis of an ideal block of materials leading to direct evaluation of the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. The influence of block size and representative volume elements (RVE) are discussed. The use of random fields and Monte-Carlo simulations deliver a mean and standard deviation of the elastic parameters that lead naturally to a probabilistic interpretation. The methodology is extended to a foundation problem involving a footing on an elastic foundation containing voids.

  Abstract                 = {Numerical models can help to push forward the knowledge about complex dynamic physical systems. Modern approaches employ detailed mathematical models, taking into consideration inherent uncertainties on input parameters (phenomenological parameters or boundary and initial conditions, among others). Particle-laden flows are complex physical systems found in nature, generated due to the (possible small) spatial variation on the fluid density promoted by the carried particles. They are one of the main mechanisms responsible for the deposition of sediments on the seabed. A detailed understanding of particle-laden flows, often referred to as turbidity currents, helps geologists to understand the mechanisms that give rise to reservoirs, strategic in oil exploration. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides a rational framework to assist in this task, by combining sophisticated computational models with a probabilistic perspective in order to deepen the knowledge about the physics of the problem and to access the reliability of the results obtained with numerical simulations. This work presents a stochastic analysis of sediment deposition resulting from a turbidity current considering uncertainties on the initial sediment concentrations and particles settling velocities. The statistical moments of the deposition mapping, like other important features of the currents, are approximated by a Sparse Grid Stochastic Collocation method that employ a parallel flow solver for the solution of the deterministic problems associated to the grid points. The whole procedure is supported and steered by a scientific workflow management engine designed for high performance computer applications.},

The modelling is achieved by partitioning the total soil-structure system into a near-field and a far-field with a hemispherical interface. The near-field, which consists of the structure to be analysed and a finite region of soil around it, is modelled by finite elements. The semi-infinite far-field is modelled by distributed impedance functions at the interface which are determined by system identification methods. Numerical results indicate that the proposed model makes possible realistic and economical assessment of three-dimensional soil-structure interaction for both surface and embedded structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Green functions (GFs) are an essential ingredient in waveform-based earthquake source inversions. Hence, the error due to imprecise knowledge of a crustal velocity model is one of the major sources of uncertainty of the inferred earthquake source parameters. Recent strategies in Bayesian waveform inversions rely on statistical description of the GFs uncertainty by means of a Gaussian distribution characterized by a covariance matrix. Here we use Monte-Carlo approach to estimate the GF covariance considering randomly perturbed velocity models. We analyze the dependence of the covariance on various parameters (strength of velocity model perturbations, GF frequency content, source-station distance, etc.). Recognizing that the major source of the GF uncertainty is related to the random time shifts of the signal, we propose a simplified approach to obtain approximate covariances, bypassing the numerically expensive Monte-Carlo simulations. The resulting closed-form formulas for the approximate auto-covariances and cross-covariances between stations and components can be easily implemented in existing inversion techniques. We demonstrate that the approximate covariances exhibit very good agreement with the Monte-Carlo estimates, providing realistic variations of the GF waveforms. Furthermore, we show examples of implementation of the covariance matrix in a Bayesian moment tensor inversion using both synthetic and real datasets. We demonstrate that taking the GF uncertainty into account leads to improved estimates of the moment tensor parameters and their uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {Uplifting of and yielding below shallow foundations supporting rigid lateral force-resisting elements can provide additional nonlinearity into a system{\textquoteright}s overall force-deformation behavior. While this nonlinearity may be advantageous, potentially reducing seismic demands, displacement compatibility may result in overstress of lateral and/or gravity-resisting elements. Incorporating this balance of benefit versus consequence in structural design is one goal of performance-based earthquake engineering PBEE . There are a variety of approaches in design codes for estimating seismic demands and incorporating {\textquotedblleft}performance{\textquotedblright} as a design goal. Such methods generally account for the displacement of an equivalent SDOF system by reducing the design strength, however, not explicitly for the case of foundation uplift. To address this shortcoming, this paper investigates the relationship between the strength ratio R and the displacement ratio C1 using the beam on nonlinear Winkler foundation BNWF concept. Numerical models were constructed considering a range of soil-structure natural periods and a range of design R values. Nineteen ground motions with a broad range of characteristics are used to conduct nonlinear time-history analyses. Results from these simulations indicate that current suggestions for C1-R relations are highly unconservative when uplifting foundations are anticipated. Revised C1-R relations for uplifting foundations are presented and an example numerical comparison provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models of soil nonlinearity in common use and recently developed nonlinear codes are compared to investigate the range of their predictions. We consider equivalent linear formulations with and without frequency-dependent moduli and damping ratios and nonlinear formulations for total and effective stress. Average velocity profiles to 150 m depth with midrange National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program site classifications (B, BC, C, D, and E) in the top 30 m are used to compare the response of a wide range of site conditions from rock to soft soil. Nonlinear soil models are compared using the amplification spectrum, calculated as the ratio of surface ground motion to the input motion at the base of the velocity profile. Peak input motions from 0.1g to 0.9g are considered. For site class B, no significant differences exist between the models considered in this article. For site classes BC and C, differences are small at low input motions (0.1g to 0.2g), but become significant at higher input levels. For site classes D and E the overdamping of frequencies above about 4 Hz by the equivalent linear solution with frequency-independent parameters is apparent for the entire range of input motions considered. The equivalent linear formulation with frequency-dependent moduli and damping ratios under damps relative to the nonlinear models considered for site class C with larger input motions and most input levels for site classes D and E. At larger input motions the underdamping for site classes D and E is not as severe as the overdamping with the frequency-independent formulation, but there are still significant differences in the time domain. A nonlinear formulation is recommended for site classes D and E and for site classes BC and C with input motions greater than a few tenths of the acceleration of gravity. The type of nonlinear formulation to use is driven by considerations of the importance of water content and the availability of laboratory soils data. Our average amplification curves from a nonlinear effective stress formulation compare favorably with observed spectral amplification at class D and E sites in the Seattle area for the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.},

  Abstract                 = {In the evolution of methods for calculating synthetic time histories of ground motion for postulated earthquakes, kinematic source models have dominated to date because of their ease of application. Dynamic models, however, which incorporate a physical relationship between important faulting parameters of stress drop, slip, rupture velocity, and rise time, are becoming more accessible. This article compares a class of kinematic models based on the summation of a fractal distribution of subevent sizes with a dynamic model based on the slip-weakening friction law. Kinematic modeling is done for the frequency band 0.2 to 10.0. Hz, dynamic models are calculated from 0.2 to 2.0. Hz. The strong motion data set for the 1994 Northridge earthquake is used to evaluate and compare the synthetic time histories. Source models are propagated to the far field by convolution with 1D and 3D theoretical Green{\textquoteright}s functions. In addition, the kinematic model is used to evaluate the importance of propagation path effects: velocity structure, scattering, and nonlinearity. At present, the kinematic model gives a better broadband fit to the Northridge ground motion than the simple slip-weakening dynamic model. In general, the dynamic model overpredicts rise times and produces insufficient shorter-period energy. Within the context of the slip-weakening model, the Northridge ground motion requires a short slip-weakening distance, on the order of 0.15 m or less. A more complex dynamic model including rate weakening or one that allows shorter rise times near the hypocenter may fit the data better.},

  Abstract                 = {Deep unconsolidated deposits of the Mississippi Embayment overlie the New Madrid Seismic Zone, considered the most seismically active zone in the Eastern US. The deposits range in thickness from less than 100 m in the St. Louis area to about 1 km in the Memphis area and consist of silts, clays and sands. The influence of these deposits on propagation of seismic waves remains a major source of uncertainty for site response analysis. This paper describes the development of a new non-linear one-dimensional site response analysis model for vertical propagation of horizontal shear waves in deep soil deposits. Soil response is modeled using a modified hyperbolic model with extended Masing criteria to represent hysteretic loading and unloading of soil. The new soil model accounts for the influence of large confining pressures on strain dependent modulus degradation and damping of soil. The model is calibrated using measured shear modulus degradation and damping data from resonant column tests on sand samples under confining pressures up to 3.5 MPa. The new model is used to estimate ground motion amplification and attenuation for three soil columns 100, 500 and 1000 m thick, representative of soil thickness variability within the Embayment. The new model shows that some high frequency components of ground motion are transmitted through these deep deposits. These components are usually filtered out using conventional wave propagation methods. Longer period waves develop in deposits of 500-1000 m thickness. Spectral amplification factors of deep deposits are greater than unity and can be as large as 5 in the longer period range of 2-10 s. Preliminary evaluation of model results show that computed surface response spectra in the period range of 0.5-2 s are larger than the 1997 NEHRP recommended design response spectrum. The proposed model highlights the need to account for depth dependence of modulus and damping properties of soils in seismic wave propagation through deep soils. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Various constitutive models for the description of the elastoplastic deformation with an anisotropic hardening and also a transition from the elastic to the normal-yield (fully-plastic) state have been proposed in the past. Among them the two surface model has been widely used for predictions of metal or soil deformation behavior, which is regarded as a simplification of the multi surface model (a field of hardening moduli) extended from the kinematic hardening model. The past formulation of this model is not given in a mathematically exact form with generality applicable to materials with not only hardening but also softening behavior. In this paper, a reasonable formulation of the two surface model is given by deriving a mathematical condition which must be satisfied in order that surfaces do not intersect in their relative translation and which will be called a "non-intersection condition" and by proposing a reasonable measure to represent an approaching degree to the normal-yield stale. This model is extended to the three surface model which enables a smooth elastic plastic transition to be described. Besides, a loading criterion for hardening/softening materials is derived in a stress formulation. Finally, some comments on past models or formulations are made compared with the present formulation. {\copyright} 1988.},

  Abstract                 = {A rate-dependent inelastic constitutive equation is formulated by extending the elastoplastic constitutive equation so as to retain the latter's mathematical structure and thus reduce to the latter equation at an infinitesimal rate of deformation. That structure differs substantially from that of the over-stress model, the best-known rate-dependent inelastic constitutive model. The proposed constitutive model is a type of superposition model, which is premised on the additive decomposition of the inelastic strain rate into the plastic and creep strain rates. The plastic strain rate is formulated so as to become suppressed as the rate of deformation increases but is induced even at the infinite rate of deformation. This is the distinguishing features of this model from the existing superposition models. The present model can describe realistically the rate-dependent inelastic deformation for a wide range of strain rates. On the other hand, the over-stress model cannot predict appropriately the difference of mechanical response due to the rate of deformation, especially being inapplicable to the description of deformation at high rate of deformation as known from the unrealistic prediction of the infinite strength at an infinite rate of deformation. The proposed model is applied to various metals, and its adequacy is verified through comparisons with various test data under a wide variety of strain rates and temperatures. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The displacement discontinuity (dislocation) on the fault plane is assumed to have the form of a unilaterally propagating finite ramp function in time. The calculated wave forms in the vicinity of the fault plane are quite similar to those observed at the strong motion station nearest the fault plane at the Parkfield earthquake. The comparison suggests that the propagating ramp time function is roughly representative of the main features of the dislocation motion on the fault plane, but that the actual motion has somewhat more high frequency complexity. Calculated amplitudes indicate that the average final dislocation on the fault at the Parkfield earthquake was more than an order of magnitude greater than the offsets observed on the visible surface trace. Computer generated wave form plots are presented for a variety of locations with respect to the fault plane and for two different assumptions on the relation between fault length and ramp function duration.},

  Abstract                 = {Starting with a Green{\textquoteright}s function representation of the solution of the elastic field equations for the case of a prescribed displacement discontinuity on a fault surface, it is shown that a shear fault (relative displacement parallel to the fault plane) is rigorously equivalent to a distribution of double-couple point sources over the fault plane. In the case of a tensile fault (relative displacement normal to the fault plane) the equivalent point source distribution is composed of force dipoles normal to the fault plane with a superimposed purely compressional component. Assuming that the fault break propagates in one direction along the long axis of the fault plane and that the relative displacement at a given point has the form of a ramp time function of finite duration, T, the total radiated P and S wave energies and the total energy spectral densities are evaluated in closed form in terms of the fault plane dimensions, final fault displacement, the time constant T, and the fault propagation velocity. Using fault parameters derived principally from the work of Ben-Menahem and Toks{\"o}z on the Kamchatka earthquake of November 4, 1952, the calculated total energy appears to be somewhat low and the calculated energy spectrum appears to be deficient at short periods. It is suggested that these discrepancies are due to over-simplification of the assumed model, and that they may be corrected by (1) assuming a somewhat roughened ramp for the fault displacement time function to correspond to a stick-slip type of motion, and (2) assuming that the short period components of the fault displacement wave are coherent only over distances considerably smaller than the total fault length.},

The iterations for solving the nonlinear equations are bypassed considering that the explicit integration used in the code requires a very small time increment; as a result, the high efficiency of the original linear procedure is preserved. This nonlinear code allows us to perform a deterministic seismic-hazard analysis that considers the nonlinear behaviors of the propagation path and local site for an engineering site. After checking its accuracy against the commercial finite-element method program ABAQUS, the extended nonlinear SEM is used to investigate the effect of noncausative faults on the seismic ground motion at the Dagangshan dam site in Southwest China. The analysis of the study case shows that the isolation effect of noncausative faults is dependent on the fault-source relative position, and the nonlinear responses of the faults are sensitive to earthquake magnitude.},

  Abstract                 = {The basic assumption that the self-similarity and the spectral law of the seismic body-wave radiation (e.g., ω-square model) must find their origin in some simple self-similar process during the seismic rupture led us to construct a kinematic, self-similar model of earthquakes. It is first assumed that the amplitude of the slip distribution high-pass filtered at high wavenumber does not depend on the size of the ruptured fault. This leads to the following {\textquotedblleft}k-square{\textquotedblright} model for the slip spectrum, for k \&gt; 1/L: Δ~uL(k)=CΔσμLk2, where L is the ruptured fault dimension, k the radial wavenumber, Δσ the mean stress drop, μ the rigidity, and C an adimensional constant of the order of 1. The associated stress-drop spectrum, for k \&gt; 1/L, is approximated by Δ~σL(k)=ΔσLk. The rupture front is assumed to propagate on the fault plane with a constant velocity v, and the rise time function is assumed to be scale dependent. The partial slip associated to a given wavelength 1/k is assumed to be completed in a time 1/kv, based on simple dynamical considerations. We therefore considered a simple dislocation model (instantaneous slip at the final value), which indeed correctly reproduces this self-similar characteristic of the slip duration at any scale. For a simple rectangular fault with isochrones propagating in the x direction, the resulting far-field displacement spectrum is related to the slip spectrum as u\~{}(ω)=FΔ~u(kx=1Cdωv,ky=0), where the factor F includes radiation pattern and distance effect, and Cd is the classical directivity coefficient 1/[1 - v/c cos (θ)]. The k-square model for the slip thus leads to the ω-square model, with the assumptions above. Independently of the adequacy of these assumptions, which should be tested with dynamic numerical models, such a kinematic model has several important applications. It may indeed be used for generating realistic synthetics at any frequency, including body waves, surface waves, and near-field terms, even for sites close to the fault, which is often of particular importance; it also provides some clues for estimating the weighting factors for the empirical Green{\textquoteright}s function methods. Finally, the slip spectrum may easily be modified in order to model other power-law decay of the radiation spectra, as well as composite earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {An efficient mathematical method is presented for computing the near-fault strong ground motions in a layered half-space, giving explicit consideration to the static offset due to surface faulting. In addition, the combined effects of ``fling step'' and ``rupture directivity'' on the near-fault ground motions are investigated. First, after checking the fault integration in the representation theorem, it is found that when an observation point is close to the fault plane, Green's functions exhibit near singularities, which consist of extremely sharp peaks in a narrow band close to the observation point. Therefore, direct numerical integration becomes quite onerous for computing near-fault ground motions, because the dynamic Green's functions must then be distributed very densely in order to evaluate accurately the effects of the near singularities. Instead, a new form of the representation theorem is introduced, which exploits the property that the dynamic Green's functions can be approximated by the corresponding static Green's functions in the vicinity of the singularities. The modified theorem, which involves the device of adding and subtracting the static Green's functions from the dynamic ones, is the sum of two fault integrations. The first integration involves the difference of the dynamic and the corresponding static Green's functions, while the second contains only the static Green's functions. This formulation requires much less CPU time than the original one when near-fault ground motions are considered, because the near singularities of the dynamic Green's functions in the first integration are completely eliminated by subtracting the static Green's functions. While the second integration does require a densely distributed set of points to capture the near-singular behavior of the static Green's function, it needs to be performed only once, as it is valid for all frequencies. Subtraction of the static Green's functions from the dynamic functions has the added benefit of making the integration over the wavenumber in the determination of the Green's functions much more efficient, especially for surface faulting. This is because the difference of the dynamic and static integrands converges rapidly to zero with increasing wavenumbers, whereas the original integrands diverge in the case of a source point on the free surface. The proposed methodology is used to investigate the two most important effects in near-fault ground motions, fling step (e.g., Abrahamson, 2001) and rupture directivity (e.g., Somerville et al., 1997), by paying special attention to the contribution of static and dynamic Green's functions. It is found that the fling effects stem mainly from the second integral in the modified representation theorem, which involves the static Green's function. The fling effects are dominant in the slip direction only in the vicinity of the surface fault and are negligible for buried faults, because the static Green's function attenuates rapidly with distance from the fault, r, as the order of (1/r2). Also, more importantly, when an observation point is located above a buried fault, the medium has to remain continuous, and thus cannot ``fling.'' By contrast, the directivity effects stem mainly from the first integral, which involves the dynamic Green's function, and attenuate much more slowly than the fling, on the order from 1/r to [IMG]f1.gif`` ALT=''Formula`` BORDER=''0``>. The directivity effects are dominant in the fault-normal direction, especiallyin the forward rupture direction, not only for the surface fault, but also for the buried fault. Due to the combined effects of fling and directivity in the vicinity of the surface fault, the directions of the maximum velocities and displacements are inclined with respect to the fault plane. On the other hand, when softer surface layers are added to the medium, the directivity effects become more significant than the fling effects, because the dynamic Green's functions are more pronounced than the static ones. },

  Abstract                 = {Despite its complicated history the Ivrea Zone is considered to be a representative surface exposure of extended continental crust. We have digitized two standard 1:25,000 geological maps from this area and evaluated their structural statistics. Because of the subvertical orientation of the Ivrea Zone these maps can be considered as small-scale cross sections through the lower continental crust. The autocorrelation functions of the digitized lithologies measured from these maps show a clear self-similar or fractal rather than a Gaussian or deterministic trend. We found that an anisotropic von Karman correlation function with an aspect ratio around 4 and a Hurst number of 0.3, corresponding to a fractal dimension of 2.7, matches the observed data. Our results represent an explicit confirmation of previous indirect evidence for the fractal nature of lithospheric heterogeneities and provide the means to construct realistic crustal-scale seismic models of Ivrea-type lower continental crust.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2007 Niigataken Chuetsu-Oki earthquake occurred near the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Japan, the largest in the world. The strong motions were recorded by seven seismometers installed at the foundation slab (base-mat) of the plant and exceeded the design level of the ground motion for the plant. The strong motion observed by the seismographs in and around the plant show high coherency with three significant pulses. In order to understand the cause of these pulses, the rupture process of the earthquake was estimated using these seismograms. The seismograph network was taken into account as a dense array and semblance-enhanced waveform stacking was performed. By projecting the power of the stacked waveforms onto the fault plane, the asperities that generated significant pulses were successfully separated. The first and third pulses were generated at the hypocenter and the southwest edge of the rupture zone, respectively. The rupture propagated toward the southwest and terminated offshore from the power plant. The overall pattern of the imaged asperities coincides well with the slip distribution determined by conventional waveform inversions. 10.1785/0120080062},

The warning announcement is broadcast by various ways, such as TV, radio, and cellular phone broadcasting messages. This chapter reviews the performance of the \{JMA\} \{EEW\} system over its first 5 years, during which time the Mw9.0 Tohoku Earthquake occurred. During the earthquake, the system functioned as designed for the Tohoku district. However, it underpredicted the seismic intensity of the mainshock for the Kanto district due to the large extent of the fault rupture, and it issued some false alarms due to multiple simultaneous aftershocks. A questionnaire survey indicates that most people consider the \{EEW\} useful despite the occurrence of false alarms. },

Dyn., this issue) for strong motion prediction with higher resolution and accuracy. The MMAM takes advantage of the bounding medium theory to obtain optimistic and pessimistic estimates of the expected strong motion and the singular perturbation expansion that leads to an efficient multi-scale analysis. The results of the numerical simulation with the MMAM are given as the sum of waves of low resolution covering the whole city and waves of high resolution for each part of the city. While the huge computation amount is reduced by the MMAM, the computation amount is huge still. For resolving this problem, this paper applies the finite element method with voxel element to numerical simulation tools after some numerical verification. To reproduce complicated material properties of surface soft deposits, fundamental hysteresis attenuation is implemented in the three-dimensional simulation code. The proposed method is verified by carrying out the strong motion prediction with MMAM and comparing with measured data. In addition, the effect of three-dimensional soil–structure and frequency component on the maximum velocity distribution, which is simulated by proposed method with high spatial resolution, is discussed.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new analysis method, called macro–micro analysis method (MMAM) for numerical simulation of wave propagation in stochastic media, which could be used to predict distribution of earthquake strong motion with high accuracy and spatial resolution. This MMAM takes advantage of the bounding medium theory (BMT) and the singular perturbation expansion (SPE). BMT can resolve uncertainty of soil and crust structures by obtaining optimistic and pessimistic estimates of expected strong motion distribution. SPE leads to efficient multi-scale analysis for reducing a huge amount of computation. The MMAM solution is given as the sum of waves of low resolution covering a whole city and waves of high resolution for each city portion. This paper presents BMT and SPE along with the formulation of MMAM for wave propagation in three-dimensional elastic media. Application examples are presented to verify the validity of the MMAM and demonstrate potential usefulness of this approach. In a companion paper (Earthquake Engng. Struct. Dyn., this issue) application examples of earthquake strong motion prediction are also presented. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Although the availability of experimental data on clay is still limited at this time, the formulas fit those data reasonably well and could be conveniently utilized in dynamic analyses such as seismic ground response and soil-structure interaction problems.},

  Abstract                 = { Geotechnical engineers recognize the variability of the geological materials they work with, including uncertainties associated with subsurface characterization tasks. These uncertainties include data scattering, such as real spatial variation in soil properties, or random testing errors. Systematic errors, as can occur in bias measurement procedures, are also common. In almost all construction projects, penetration tests play a major role in subsoil characterization. Interpretation of test results is mostly empirical, and it is therefore prudent to find a suitable computational method to minimize the error in predicting values at points away from actual test locations. In this research, the capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are assessed as a computational method for predicting standard penetration test (SPT) results at any point (x, y, z) in a field where a set of SPTs is performed. SPT and moisture content data for five bore holes are used to train and test the developed three-dimensional network models. To graphically visualize the underlying soil strata, select contour maps of blows and moisture content values at various locations are presented. The results obtained indicate the viability and flexibility of ANN methodology as an efficient tool for site characterization tasks. },

  Abstract                 = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein$-$protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\leq$ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is presented for calculating the seismic response of a system of horizontal soil layers. The essential element of the method is a rheological model suggested by Iwan which takes account of the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of soils and has considerable flexibility for incorporating laboratory results on the dynamic behavior of soils. Finite rigidity is allowed in the underlying elastic medium, permitting energy to be radiated back into the underlying medium. Three alternate ways of integrating the equations of motion are compared, an implicit technique, an explicit technique, and integration along characteristics. An example is set up for comparing the different methods of integration and for comparing the nonlinear solution with a solution based on the widely used equivalent linear assumption. The example consists of a 200-m section of firm alluvium excited at its base by the N21E component of the Taft accelerogram multiplied by four to produce a peak acceleration of 0.7 g and a peak velocity of 67 cm/sec. The three techniques of integration give very similar results, but integration along characteristics has the advantage of avoiding spurious high-frequency oscillations in the acceleration time history at the surface. For the chosen example, which has a thick soil column and a strong input motion, the equivalent linear solution underestimates the intensity of surface motion for periods between 0.1 and 0.6 sec by factors exceeding two. The discrepancies, however, would probably be less for input motion of lower intensity. At longer periods the equivalent linear solution is in essential agreement with the nonlinear solution. For the same example both solutions show that, compared to a site with rock at the surface, motion at the surface of the soil is amplified for periods longer than 1.5 sec by as much as a factor of two. At shorter periods the amplitude is reduced.},

  Abstract                 = {Historically, most quantitative seismological analyses have been based on the assumption that earthquakes are caused by shear faulting, for which the equivalent force system in an isotropic medium is a pair of force couples with no net torque (a {\&}{\#}8220;double couple,{\&}{\#}8221; or DC). Observations of increasing quality and coverage, however, now resolve departures from the DC model for many earthquakes and find some earthquakes, especially in volcanic and geothermal areas, that have strongly non-DC mechanisms. Understanding non-DC earthquakes is important both for studying the process of faulting in detail and for identifying nonshear-faulting processes that apparently occur in some earthquakes. This paper summarizes the theory of {\&}{\#}8220;moment tensor{\&}{\#}8221; expansions of equivalent-force systems and analyzes many possible physical non-DC earthquake processes. Contrary to long-standing assumption, sources within the Earth can sometimes have net force and torque components, described by first-rank and asymmetric second-rank moment tensors, which must be included in analyses of landslides and some volcanic phenomena. Non-DC processes that lead to conventional (symmetric second-rank) moment tensors include geometrically complex shear faulting, tensile faulting, shear faulting in an anisotropic medium, shear faulting in a heterogeneous region (e.g., near an interface), and polymorphic phase transformations. Undoubtedly, many non-DC earthquake processes remain to be discovered. Progress will be facilitated by experimental studies that use wave amplitudes, amplitude ratios, and complete waveforms in addition to wave polarities and thus avoid arbitrary assumptions such as the absence of volume changes or the temporal similarity of different moment tensor components. },

  Abstract                 = {A technique is presented for polarization analysis of three-component seismic array data. The process is applied to a large suite of regional events recorded on the three-component sensors in the NORESS array in southern Norway. Polarization properties of the regional seismic phases P,, S,, and Lg are examined in detail. The analysis technique is based on a time-domain algorithm originally proposed by Flinn (1965). The polarization ellipse is computed within sliding time windows by solving the eigenproblem for the covariance matrix. Various attributes characterizing the particle motions are extracted from the motion ellipse. This technique is extended to multiple three-component sensors in an array configu- ration by averaging covariance matrices for the different sensors. In this case a 1/M reduction in the estimation variance is obtained (M is the number of sensors), when the noise and local scattering effects are uncorrelated. An important feature of this approach is that the phase velocities of coherent wavefronts across the array are not required to a high degree of accuracy. Significant results of the data analysis are the well-defined polarization of P, and Sn waves across the entire short-period band, the source azimuth estimates obtained from P, and Lg motions, and the distinct polarization for S, and Lg waves allowing these phases to be distinguished in most cases.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new numerical approach to solve the elastic wave equation in heterogeneous media in the presence of externally given source terms with arbitrary high-order accuracy in space and time on unstructured triangular meshes. We combine a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with the ideas of the ADER time integration approach using Arbitrary high-order DERivatives. The time integration is performed via the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure using repeatedly the governing partial differential equation itself. In contrast to classical finite element methods we allow for discontinuities of the piecewise polynomial approximation of the solution at element interfaces. This way, we can use the well-established theory of fluxes across element interfaces based on the solution of Riemann problems as developed in the finite volume framework. In particular, we replace time derivatives in the Taylor expansion of the time integration procedure by space derivatives to obtain a numerical scheme of the same high order in space and time using only one single explicit step to evolve the solution from one time level to another. The method is specially suited for linear hyperbolic systems such as the heterogeneous elastic wave equations and allows an efficient implementation. We consider continuous sources in space and time and point sources characterized by a Delta distribution in space and some continuous source time function. Hereby, the method is able to deal with point sources at any position in the computational domain that does not necessarily need to coincide with a mesh point. Interpolation is automatically performed by evaluation of test functions at the source locations. The convergence analysis demonstrates that very high accuracy is retained even on strongly irregular meshes and by increasing the order of the ADER–DG schemes computational time and storage space can be reduced remarkably. Applications of the proposed method to Lamb's Problem, a problem of strong material heterogeneities and to an example of global seismic wave propagation finally confirm its accuracy, robustness and high flexibility.},

  Abstract                 = {Practical procedures for modeling basin structure are proposed. One is to construct a smooth 3D basin structure model under and around the target site for low-frequency strong motion simulation. The other is to make a 1D velocity structure model just under the target site for high frequencies. These procedures were applied to the Osaka basin, Japan, in which numerous exploration studies were conducted before and after the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe) Earthquake. The published results of those explorations in addition to those from our several investigations were compiled to construct the model. A two-dimensional third-order B-spline function was used to establish a smooth structure model from available depth data. Microtremor array observations were used to model the velocities and densities of the sedimentary layer structures. A four-layer model well explains the dispersion characteristics of Rayleigh waves that make up the microtremors. By adding a detailed shallow velocity structure to the top of the deeper four-layer model, adequate site responses for a wide frequency range of ground motions can be obtained. This proposed procedure can be used to determine the basement geometry of other sedimentary basins. Manuscript received 14 August 2003.},

  Abstract                 = {Because of the limited number of strong-motion records that have measured ground response at large strains, any statistical analyses of seismic site-response models subject to strong ground motions are severely limited by a small number of observations. Recent earthquakes in Japan, including the Mw~9.0 Tohoku earthquake of March 2011, have substantially increased the observations of strong-motion records that can be used to compare alternative site-response models at large strains and can subsequently provide insight into the accuracy and precision of site-response models. Using the Kiban-Kyoshin network (KiK-net) downhole array data in Japan, we analyze the accuracy (bias) and variability (precision) resulting from common site-response modeling assumptions, and we identify critical parameters that significantly contribute to the uncertainty in site-response analyses. We perform linear and equivalent-linear site-response analyses at 100 KiK-net sites using 3720 ground motions ranging in amplitude from weak to strong; 204 of these records have peak ground accelerations greater than at the ground surface. We find that the maximum shear strain in the soil profile, the observed peak ground acceleration at the ground surface, and the predominant spectral period of the surface ground motion are the best predictors of where the evaluated models become inaccurate and/or imprecise. The peak shear strains beyond which linear analyses become inaccurate in predicting surface pseudospectral accelerations (PSA; presumably as a result of nonlinear soil behavior) are a function of vibration period and are between 0.01\% and 0.1\% for periods \&lt;0.5 s. Equivalent-linear analyses become inaccurate at peak strains of \~{}0.4\% over this range of periods. We find that, for the sites and ground motions considered, site-response residuals at spectral periods \&gt;0.5 s do not display noticeable effects of nonlinear soil behavior.Online Material: Site-specific information and model residuals at 100 KiK-net stations.},

  Abstract                 = {When a frictional interface is subject to a localized shear load, it is often (experimentally) observed that local slip events propagate until they arrest naturally before reaching the edge of the interface. We develop a theoretical model based on linear elastic fracture mechanics to describe the propagation of such precursory slip. The model's prediction of precursor lengths as a function of external load is in good quantitative agreement with laboratory experiments as well as with dynamic simulations, and provides thereby evidence to recognize frictional slip as a fracture phenomenon. We show that predicted precursor lengths depend, within given uncertainty ranges, mainly on the kinetic friction coefficient, and only weakly on other interface and material parameters. By simplifying the fracture mechanics model, we also reveal sources for the observed nonlinearity in the growth of precursor lengths as a function of the applied force. The discrete nature of precursors as well as the shear tractions caused by frustrated Poisson's expansion is found to be the dominant factors. Finally, we apply our model to a different, symmetric setup and provide a prediction of the propagation distance of frictional slip for future experiments.},

The framework relies upon a stochastic Galerkin formulation, where the stiffness random field is decomposed using a multidimensional polynomial chaos expansion. At the constitutive level, a Fokker–Planck–Kolmogorov (FPK) plasticity framework is utilized, under the assumption of small strain kinematics. A linearization procedure is developed that serves to update the polynomial chaos coefficients of the expanded random stiffness in the elastoplastic regime, leading to a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. The proposed framework is illustrated in a static shear beam example of elastic-perfectly plastic as well as isotropic hardening material. },

  Abstract                 = {Large historical and recent intraplate earthquakes have been concentrated along a contractional zone at the eastern margin of the Japan Sea back-arc basin. Here we present high-resolution three-dimensional tomographic imaging of seismic velocities in this zone using data from a dense seismograph deployment. We discover that stepwise and tilted block structures of the basement, which are geophysical evidence of a Miocene rift system, are widely distributed beneath the thick sedimentary basin. Most aftershocks following recent intraplate earthquakes align roughly along the tilted block boundaries and are controlled by weaknesses associated with buried rift systems. Furthermore, slow anomalies are localized beneath the seismogenic zones, suggesting that fluids may have locally weakened the strength of the lower crust. We propose that stress loading through ductile creeping of the weak lower crust reactivates pre-existing weak faults within ancient rift systems, leading to devastating intraplate earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {The magnitude, MJMA, estimated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is generally referred to in Japan for the regional seismicity in the area. MJMA is determined from maximum displacement amplitudes of the total seismic wave traces. For earthquakes shallower than 60 km, MJMA is determined by Tsuboi{\textquoteright}s formula, and for earthquakes deeper than 60 km, by Katsumata{\textquoteright}s formula. These relations were designed to give almost the same magnitude value as that of Gutenberg and Richter. We compared MJMA with moment magnitude, MW, which can be calculated from the centroid moment tensor (CMT) solutions. It was found that the average difference between MJMA and MW is not significant for shallow earthquakes in the magnitude range from 5 to 7, but it is significant at a low level for the earthquakes of deeper foci. The averaged difference reaches about 0.4 magnitude units for the focal depth of 600 km. We derived an attenuation function for the maximum displacement amplitude assuming the validity of the moment magnitude. This relation between epicentral distance and amplitude for shallow earthquakes is almost identical to the one calculated from Tsuboi{\textquoteright}s formula. It is suggested that the estimated attenuation function for deep-focus earthquakes reflects the specific Q and velocity structure that is peculiar to the subduction zone.},

The heavy damage concentration in downtown Mashiki could be understood based on the observed strong motions with the Japan Meteorological Agency instrumental seismic intensity of VII and information collected by the field investigation. First, the fundamental features of the structural damage in downtown Mashiki were summarized. Then, a distribution map of peak frequencies was derived from horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios of microtremors. We could not see any systematic correlation between the peak frequencies and spatial distribution of damage ratios. We also analyzed observed strong motion data at two sites to obtain fling-step-like motions in the displacement time histories through the double integration of unfiltered accelerograms. It turned out that at both strong motion observation sites in Mashiki, only the east--west (EW) components had very strong velocity pulses westward before the emergence of the fling-step-like motion eastward, which would be the primary cause of heavy structural damage in downtown Mashiki, not site effects nor the fling-step-like motion itself.},

  abstract  = {We have been discussing the validity of using the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratios (HVRs) as a substitute for S-wave amplifications after Nakamura first proposed the idea in 1989. So far a formula for HVRs had not been derived that fully utilized their physical characteristics until a recent proposal based on the diffuse field concept. There is another source of confusion that comes from the mixed use of HVRs from earthquake and microtremors, although their wave fields are hardly the same. In this study, we compared HVRs from observed microtremors (MHVR) and those from observed earthquake motions (EHVR) at one hundred K-NET and KiK-net stations. We found that MHVR and EHVR share similarities, especially until their first peak frequency, but have significant differences in the higher frequency range. This is because microtremors mainly consist of surface waves so that peaks associated with higher modes would not be prominent, while seismic motions mainly consist of upwardly propagating plain body waves so that higher mode resonances can be seen in high frequency. We defined here the spectral amplitude ratio between them as EMR and calculated their average. We categorize all the sites into five bins by their fundamental peak frequencies in MHVR. Once we obtained EMRs for five categories, we back-calculated EHVRs from MHVRs, which we call pseudo-EHVRs (pEHVR). We found that pEHVR is much closer to EHVR than MHVR. Then we use our inversion code to invert the one-dimensional S-wave velocity structures from EHVRs based on the diffuse field concept. We also applied the same code to pEHVRs and MHVRs for comparison. We found that pEHVRs yield velocity structures much closer to those by EHVRs than those by MHVRs. This is natural since what we have done up to here is circular except for the average operation in EMRs. Finally, we showed independent examples of data not used in the EMR calculation, where better ground structures were successfully identified from pEHVRs again. Thus we proposed here a simple empirical method to estimate S-wave velocity structures using single-station microtremor records, which is the most cost-effective method to characterize the site effects. },

  Abstract                 = {The Horizontal-to-Vertical spectral ratios of microtremors (MHVR) have been utilized as a convenient tool to extract a predominant frequency at a target site. The so-called Nakamura method, which was proposed by Nakamura in 80's, assumed that MHVR provides us directly the S-wave amplification factor of earthquake in the horizontal component, that is, Horizontal-to-Horizontal spectral ratio (HHR) with respect to the bedrock, although the validity of the method had never been proved. Recently, based on the diffuse field concept (DFC) proposed by Sánchez-Sesma and others in 2011 MHVRs are found to correspond to the square root of the ratio of the imaginary part of the displacement for a unit harmonic load in the horizontal direction with respect to the corresponding one in the vertical direction. With the same DFC for body waves Horizontal-to-Vertical spectral ratios of earthquake (EHVR) correspond to the ratio of the horizontal motion for a vertical incidence of S wave with respect to the vertical correspondent of P wave, as revealed by Kawase and others in 2011. Thus there should be a systematic difference between EHVR and MHVR because of the difference in their primary contribution of wave types. We first calculated the ratios of EHVR with respect to MHVR (EMR) at 100 strong motion stations in Japan. Then we normalized frequency by the fundamental peak frequency at each site and calculated the average of EMRs for five categories based on their fundamental peak frequencies. Once we got empirical EMRs for five categories we transformed MHVRs into pseudo EHVRs. At the same time we calculated the average Vertical-to-Vertical spectral ratios (VVRs) for the same sites using the generalized spectral inversion technique (GIT) of Nakano et al. (2015) [16]. Finally the S-wave amplification factor, HHR, of earthquake ground motion at the site were calculated from MHVR with double corrections using EMR and VVR for the corresponding category. We compared these final empirical prediction with the observed HHRs from GIT to find quite high correlations and small overall residuals. The proposed method to get HHR from MHVR with these double empirical corrections can be considered as a natural but significant extension to the so-called Nakamura method.},

  Abstract                 = {At long lapse times in the weakly scattering regime, the energy of the coda in a randomly fluctuating isotropic medium is equipartitioned between P and S modes. This behavior is well understood mathematically and physically for full spaces. For realistic domains, analytical results are more scarce and numerical simulations become a valuable tool. This paper discusses, based on numerical simulations of wave propagation in a 3D randomly heterogeneous elastic medium, the transition to an equipartitioned regime of the wave field. Both the time to transition and the value of the ratio of energies after transition are evaluated. Several influencing parameters are discussed, either physical (ratio of background P- and S- velocities, propagation length, variance of the heterogeneities) or numerical (influence of Perfectly Matched Layers). Setting up of a localization regime, inefficient mixture of body waves and small propagation length compared to the transport mean free paths are identified as constraining for the transition toward an equipartition regime.},

  Abstract                 = {In the weakly heterogeneous regime of elastic wave propagation through a random medium, transport and diffusion models for the energy densities can be set up. In the isotropic case, the scattering cross sections are explicitly known as a function of the wavenumber and the correlations of the Lamé parameters and density. In this paper, we discuss the precise influence of the correlation structure on the scattering cross sections, mean free paths and diffusion parameter, and separate that influence from that of the correlation length and variance. We also analyze the convergence rates towards the low- and high-frequency ranges. For all analyses, we consider five different correlation structures that allow us to explore a wide range of behaviors. We identify that the controlling factors for the low-frequency behavior are the value of the Power Spectral Density Function (PSDF) and its first non-vanishing derivative at the origin. In the high frequency range, the controlling factor is the third moment of the PSDF (which may be unbounded).},

  Abstract                 = {An online identification and control scheme based on a wavelet neural network (WNN) and model predictive control (MPC) are presented. The WNN comprises a backpropagation neural network with wavelet activation functions and a parallel feedforward term. The WNN is used to identify the structural system, and the model is used to provide the predictions for MPC. The backpropagation network parameters and the controller are trained by the gradient descent algorithm to minimize performance indices. The feedforward component is trained using recursive least squares. The latter is found to drastically reduce the number of hidden layer neurons and significantly reduce the computational load of the neural network. Due to the general structure of the controller, its performance is satisfactory even under the strict condition imposed by a fixed learning rate. The efficacy of the control was demonstrated through a series of computational simulations of a 5‐story seismically isolated structure with conventional lead‐rubber bearings. Significant reductions of all response amplitudes were achieved for both near‐field (pulse) and far‐field ground motions, including reduced deformations along with corresponding reduction in acceleration response. In particular, the controller effectively regulated the apparent stiffness at the isolation level.},

With the assumption that all the constituent events of a multiple shock have identical fault geometry and depth, the far-field source time function is obtained as a superposition of ramp functions. The height and the onset time of the ramp functions are determined by matching the synthetic waveforms with the observed ones in the least-square sense.The individual events are then identified by pairs of ramp functions or discrete trapezoidal pulses in the source time sequence. The method can be used for the analysis of both single and multi-station data. Teleseismic long-period P waves from the 1976 Guatemala earthquake are analyzed as a test of our method. The present method provides a useful tool for a systematic analysis of multiple event sequences.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle motion was examined along the following kinematic fault model: the fault plane is a rectangle so elongated that differences in particle motion in the shorter dimension can be neglected and rupture, once initiated, can be considered to propagate only in the longitudinal direction(s) at constant speed; the distribution of particle displacement along the ruptured fault segment maintains the same sinusoidal shape at different times until finally all particles stop simultaneously. It was found that the pattern of particle motion in this model depends on whether the rupture propagates unilaterally or bilaterally. For the bilateral case, particle displacement and velocity are nearly a finite ramp and a box-car function of time, respectively. The maximum particle velocity is the same everywhere along the final ruptured fault segment, but the average velocity is slightly higher for particles closer to the ends. For the unilateral case, particle velocity is approximately an impulse function of time for particles near the starting edge and gradually becomes a box-car function for particles near the ending edge of rupture. The maximum velocity is the same for all particles along the fault segment, but the average velocity is considerably higher for particles closer to the ending edge. It is not a good approximation for either of these cases to assume that all the particles along the fault segment have the same displacement-time function with only a time delay.},

  Abstract                 = {Starting from a thermomechanical description of elastoplasticity, a stress-based variational principle is derived. The principle, which generalizes von Mises's principle of maximum plastic dissipation, reproduces the conventional elastic/hardening-plastic framework applicable to metals as a special case and further proves to be suitable for developing constitutive models for frictional materials. Application of the principle to the isotropic and triaxal compression behaviour of sands is considered by means of a non-conventional extension of the modified Cam clay model. The new model allows for the specification of arbitrary stress-dilatancy relations without altering the yield potential or introducing a separate flow potential. Moreover, the elastoplastic tangent modulus is always symmetric, regardless of the degree of apparent nonassociativity. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {One-dimensional nonlinear ground response analyses provide a more accurate characterization of the true nonlinear soil behavior than equivalent-linear procedures, but the application of nonlinear codes in practice has been limited, which results in part from poorly documented and unclear parameter selection and code usage protocols. In this article, exact ?linear frequency-domain? solutions for body wave propagation through an elastic medium are used to establish guidelines for two issues that have long been a source of confusion for filippos of nonlinear codes. The first issue concerns the specification of input motion as {\textquotedblleft}outcropping{\textquotedblright} ?i.e., equivalent free-surface motions? versus {\textquotedblleft}within{\textquotedblright} ?i.e., motions occurring at depth within a site profile?. When the input motion is recorded at the ground surface ?e.g., at a rock site?, the full outcropping ?rock? motion should be used along with an elastic base having a stiffness appropriate for the underlying rock. The second issue concerns the specification of viscous damping ?used in most nonlinear codes? or small-strain hysteretic damping ?used by one code considered herein?, either of which is needed for a stable solution at small strains. For a viscous damping formulation, critical issues include the target value of the viscous damping ratio and the frequencies for which the viscous damping produced by the model matches the target. For codes that allow the use of {\textquotedblleft}full{\textquotedblright} Rayleigh damping ?which has two target frequencies?, the target damping ratio should be the small-strain material damping, and the target frequencies should be established through a process by which linear time domain and frequency domain solutions are matched. As a first approximation, the first-mode site frequency and five times that frequency can be used. For codes with different damping models, alternative recommendations are developed.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this article is to investigate the possibility of reducing the uncertainty of the ground motion predicted for a specific target area (Po Plain and northeastern Italy), by calibrating a set of ad hoc ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs). The derived GMPEs account for peculiarities that are not generally considered by standard predictive models, such as (1)~an attenuation rate dependent on distance ranges and geological domains; (2)~enhancement of short-period spectral ordinates, due to the reflection of S waves at the Moho discontinuity; and (3)~generation of surface waves inside an alluvial basin.The analyzed strong-motion dataset was compiled by selecting events in the 4.0{\textendash}6.4 magnitude range, records with distances shorter than 200~km, and focal depths shallower than 30~km; the major contribution comes from the recent 2012 Emilia sequence (first mainshock, 20 May 2012 Mw~6.1; second mainshock, 29 May 2015 Mw~6.0). The GMPEs are derived for the geometrical mean of horizontal components of peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, and 5\% damped spectral acceleration in the 0.04{\textendash}4~s period range.The derived region-specific models led to a reduction of the hazard levels for several intensity measures, with respect to the values obtained by considering the reference Italian attenuation model (Bindi et~al., 2011), as exemplified by the comparison of the hazard curves computed for two specific sites.Online Material: Database of Northern Italy (DBNI) flat-file and tables of northern Italy ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) (NI15) regression coefficients and variability components for use with Joyner{\textendash}Boore and hypocentral distances.},

  Abstract                 = { Deep belief networks (DBN) are generative neural network models with many layers of hidden explanatory factors, recently introduced by Hinton, Osindero, and Teh (2006) along with a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm. The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs within DBNs. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new method to indirectly determine the probability distribution function of strength of quasibrittle structures. The method is derived within the framework of the finite weakest link model, which indicates that the size dependence of the mean structural strength can be calculated from the size effect on the probability distribution of the structural strength. By considering the inversion of this model, we show that the cumulative distribution function of structural strength can be explicitly determined from the parameters of the mean size effect curve. The proposed method is verified by a comprehensive set of experiments on asphalt mixture at a low temperature, which involves tests on both the strength histograms and the mean size effect. In the meantime, the agreement between the predicted and experimentally measured strength histograms of asphalt mixture specimens of different sizes further confirms the validity of the finite weakest link model. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In F3DT, the sensitivity (Fr�chet) kernels are computed using numerical solutions of the 3-D elastodynamic equation and the nonlinearity of the structural inversion problem is accounted for through an iterative tomographic navigation process. More than half-a-million misfit measurements made on about 38,000 earthquake seismograms and 12,000 ambient-noise correlagrams have been assimilated into our inversion. After 26 F3DT iterations, synthetic seismograms computed using our latest model, CVM-S4.26, show substantially better fit to observed seismograms at frequencies below 0.2?Hz than those computed using our 3-D starting model CVM-S4 and the other SCEC CVM, CVM-H11.9, which was improved through 16 iterations of AW-F3DT. CVM-S4.26 has revealed strong crustal heterogeneities throughout Southern California, some of which are completely missing in CVM-S4 and CVM-H11.9 but exist in models obtained from previous crustal-scale 2-D active-source refraction tomography models. At shallow depths, our model shows strong correlation with sedimentary basins and reveals velocity contrasts across major mapped strike-slip and dip-slip faults. At middle to lower crustal depths, structural features in our model may provide new insights into regional tectonics. When combined with physics-based seismic hazard analysis tools, we expect our model to provide more accurate estimates of seismic hazards in Southern California.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the evaluation of cyclic hardening models within the stress-strain behavior of aluminum alloy AC4C-T6 that can be used to LNG cargo pump operating in cryogenic temperature. To insure the strength assessment of LNG cargo pump, material model of cyclic hardening and plasticity for aluminum alloy AC4C-T6 is investigated through FEA (Finite Element Analysis) with various hardening options including linear and non-linear hardening, isotropic and kinematic hardening, and combined hardening model. Monotonic tensile and cyclic tensile experiments for AC4C-T6 alloy were performed at room temperature and temperature of -165 ??C. Parameters of each hardening model are obtained from the experimental data; thus five hardening models are numerically simulated thereafter. Appropriate hardening models which describe the cyclic stress-strain relationship are investigated through the simulations of cyclic hardening behavior by FEA. In order to verify the predicted behavior of cyclic hardening obtained by FEA, the results of FEA and those measured by experiments are compared. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Active thrust faults pose a significant seismic hazard worldwide. Many of these faults include \BFblind\BF thrusts, where the propagating fault tip does not reach the Earth's surface, and \BFburied\BF faults, where the geomorphic expression of the fault is obscured by subsequent sedimentation and/or erosion. This raises the issue of whether conventional geologic, geomorphic, and paleoseismic methods can be used to identify and characterize thrust faults for the assessment of seismic hazards or whether these faults sometimes are truly \BFblind.\BF We compiled a data base of 148 worldwide moderate- to large-magnitude thrust/reverse earthquakes to evaluate whether or not the event occurred on a fault that could have been identified prior to the earthquake on the basis of recognizable Quaternary surface deformation (i.e., a pre-existing fault or fold). Analysis of the data shows that interplate reverse earthquakes almost always are associated with pre-existing Quaternary deformation that was or could have been recognized prior to the earthquake. In particular, most interplate reverse earthquakes are associated with an active reverse fault at the surface and/or an active anticline. In contrast, intraplate reverse earthquakes seldom occur on faults associated with pre-existing recognizable surface deformation. We conclude that thrust faults can be detected in interplate regions with careful Quaternary geologic and geomorphic mapping; furthermore, the absence of Quaternary surface deformation can be used to infer the absence of an underlying active blind thrust fault in interplate tectonic settings. However, the data show that Quaternary geologic mapping techniques alone likely are insufficient to characterize blind thrusts in intraplate regions. In these areas, inclusion of a floating or random earthquake may be necessary to assess earthquake hazards.},

To mitigate this problem, we train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the characteristics of first-arrival earthquake P waves, using 300,000 waveforms recorded in southern California and Japan. We apply the GAN critic as an automatic feature extractor and train a Random Forest classifier with about 700,000 earthquake and noise waveforms. We show that the discriminator can recognize 99.2\% of the earthquake P waves and 98.4\% of the noise signals. This state-of-the-art performance is expected to reduce significantly the number of false triggers from local impulsive noise. Our study demonstrates that GANs can discover a compact and effective representation of seismic waves, which has the potential for wide applications in seismology.},

  Abstract                 = {Competing ions strongly affect heavy-metal retention and release in soils. In this study, we evaluated the sorption of Ni and Cd in single and binary Ni-Cd systems for one neutral and 2 acidic soils. Ni and Cd sorption isotherms were obtained using batch techniques over a wide range of concentrations. Both Ni and Cd adsorption isotherms exhibited strong nonlinear behavior with similar overall patterns for all soils. Sorption of Ni and Cd correlated well the cation exchange capacity for all soils. Moreover, Cd sorption by the two acidic soils was greater than Ni, whereas for the neutral soil, Ni sorption was greater than Cd. The Freundlich model was utilized to describe the family of Ni and Cd isotherms in the presence of competing ions. For both Ni and Cd isotherms, the Freundlich distribution coefficient K decreased with increasing concentration of the competing ion. The dimensionless parameter n was within a narrow range of 0.50 to 0.64 for both Ni and Cd and was not affected by the competing ion. Competitive sorption was described using the Sheindorf-Rebhun-Sheintuch (SRS) equation, which is based on multicomponent Freundlich-type models. Estimates of SRS competitive sorption coefficients indicated that for the neutral soil, Ni sorption was least affected by Cd. The SRS equation was also capable of describing the overall competitive Ni and Cd sorption patterns for all soils. However, SRS model modifications are needed to improve sorption prediction for the highest competing concentrations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method for calculating broadband time histories of ground motion based on a hybrid low-frequency/high-frequency approach with correlated source parameters. Using a finite-difference method we calculate low- frequency synthetics (< ∼1 Hz) in a 3D velocity structure. We also compute broadband synthetics in a 1D velocity model using a frequency-wavenumber method. The low frequencies from the 3D calculation are combined with the high frequencies from the 1D calculation by using matched filtering at a crossover frequency of 1 Hz. The source description, common to both the 1D and 3D synthetics, is based on correlated random distributions for the slip amplitude, rupture velocity, and rise time on the fault. This source description allows for the specification of source parameters independent of any a priori inversion results. In our broadband modeling we include correlation between slip amplitude, rupture velocity, and rise time, as suggested by dynamic fault modeling. The method of using correlated random source parameters is flexible and can be easily modified to adjust to our changing understanding of earthquake ruptures. A realistic attenuation model is common to both the 3D and 1D calculations that form the low- and high-frequency components of the broadband synthetics. The value of Q is a function of the local shear-wave velocity. To produce more accurate high-frequency amplitudes and durations, the 1D synthetics are corrected with a randomized, frequency-dependent radiation pattern. The 1D synthetics are further corrected for local site and nonlinear soil effects by using a 1D nonlinear propagation code and generic velocity structure appropriate for the site’s National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (nehrp) site classification. The entire procedure is validated by comparison with the 1994 Northridge, California, strong ground motion data set. The bias and error found here for response spectral acceleration are similar to the best results that have been published by others for the Northridge rupture.},

  Abstract                 = {A series of relatively long-period velocity pulses appearing in the later part of ground motion, which is the characterization of far-source long-period ground motions in basin (``long-period ground motion'' for short), is mainly influenced by focal mechanism, basin effect, and dispersion. It was supposed that the successive low-frequency velocity pulses in long-period ground motion caused the resonance of long-period structures in basin, which are of special concern to designers of super high-rise buildings. The authors proposed a wavelet-based successive frequency-dependent pulse extraction (WSFPE) method to identify and extract these pulses with dominant period of interest from long-period ground motions. The pulses extracted by using two frequently used methods (zero-crossing analysis, empirical mode decomposition) were compared to the pulses extracted by using WSFPE. The results demonstrate that the WSFPE provides higher resolution in time--frequency domain than the other two methods do. The velocity pulses extracted by using WSFPE are responsible for the resonance and maximum response of structure subjected to long-period ground motions. WSFPE can be used to make a better understanding of long-period ground motions and to promote the formation of long-period ground motion model which will help the seismic design of long-period structures built in sedimentary basin.},

  Abstract                 = {A simplified approach to consider the effect of spatial variability in a two-dimensional (2-D) random field for reliability analysis of basal-heave in a braced excavation in clay is presented. In contrast to the random field modeling (RFM) approach, which necessitates use of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), the proposed approach employs the equivalent variance technique to consider the effect of spatial variability so that the analysis for probability of basal-heave failure can be performed using well-established first-order reliability method (FORM). Case study shows that this simplified approach yields results that are nearly identical to those obtained from the MCS-based RFM approach. The proposed approach is shown to be effective and efficient for probabilistic analysis of basal-heave in a braced excavation in a 2-D random field. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {We study a plane circular model of a frictional fault using numerical methods. The model is dynamic since we specify the effective stress at the fault. In one model we assume that the fault appears instantaneously in the medium; in another, that the rupture nucleates at the center and that rupture proceeds at constant subsonic velocity until it suddenly stops. The total source slip is larger at the center and the rise time is also longer at the center of the fault. The dynamic slip overshoots the static slip by 15 to 35 per cent. As a consequence, the stress drop is larger than the effective stress and the apparent stress is less than one half the effective stress. The far-field radiation is discussed in detail. We distinguish three spectral regions. First, the usual constant low-frequency level. Second, an intermediate region controlled by the fault size and, finally, the high-frequency asymptote. The central region includes the corner frequency and is quite complicated. The corner frequency is shown to be inversely proportional to the width of the far-field displacement pulse which, in turn, is related to the time lag between the stopping phases. The average corner frequency of S waves v0s is related to the final source radius, a, by v0s = 0.21 β/α. The corner frequency of P waves is larger than v0s by an average factor of 1.5.},

  Abstract                 = {Finite-fault source inversions reveal the spatial complexity of earthquake slip over the fault plane. We develop a stochastic characterization of earthquake slip complexity, based on published finite-source rupture models, in which we model the distribution of slip as a spatial random field. The model most consistent with the data follows a von Karman autocorrelation function (ACF) for which the correlation lengths a increase with source dimension. For earthquakes with large fault aspect ratios, we observe substantial differences of the correlation length in the along-strike (ax) and downdip (az) directions. Increasing correlation length with increasing magnitude can be understood using concepts of dynamic rupture propagation. The power spectrum of the slip distribution can also be well described with a power law decay (i.e., a fractal distribution) in which the fractal dimension D remains scale invariant, with a median value D = 2.29 ± 0.23, while the corner wave number kc, which is inversely proportional to source size, decreases with earthquake magnitude, accounting for larger “slip patches” for large-magnitude events. Our stochastic slip model can be used to generate realizations of scenario earthquakes for near-source ground motion simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>{\&}nbsp;Within the critical state soil mechanics framework, the two-surface formulation of plasticity is coupled with the state parameter to construct a constitutive model for sands in a general stress space. The operation of the two-surface model takes place in the deviatoric stress-ratio space, and the state parameter is used to define the peak and dilatancy stress ratios of sand. The model is capable of realistically simulating stress{\&}{\#}8211;strain behaviour of sands under monotonic and cyclic, drained and undrained loading conditions. It includes features such as the softening of sands at states denser than critical as they dilate in drained loading and softening of sands looser than critical in undrained loading, and the pore-water pressure increase under undrained cyclic loading. Most important, all these simulations are achieved by a unique set of model constants at all densities and confining pressures of engineering relevance for a given sand. The numerical implementation of the model is particularly easy and efficient due to the very simple formulation. Calibration of model constants is done straightforwardly on the basis of triaxial experiments and measurements of well-known characteristics of sand stress{\&}{\#}8211;strain behaviour. Possibly the most attractive feature of the model is its simplicity and its foundation on concepts and data which are well established and understood by the geotechnical engineering community, with basic reference to critical state soil mechanics.</p>$\backslash$n<p>{\&}nbsp;Dans le contexte de la m{\&}{\#}233;canique des sols {\&}{\#}224; I'tat critique, on combine la formulation de la plasticit{\&}{\#}233; {\&}{\#}233; deux surfaces et le param{\&}{\#}233;tre d'{\&}{\#}233;tat pour construire un mod{\&}{\#}233;le constitudf pour les sables dans un espace de tension g{\&}{\#}233;n{\&}{\#}233;rale.

The use of GPU computing in FEA is today an active research field. This is primary due to current GPU sparse solvers are partially parallelizable and can hardly make use of Data-Level Parallelism (DLP) for which GPU architectures are designed. The proposed GPU instance takes advantage of Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) architectures performing well-balanced parallel calculations at the Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) level of finite elements. The numerical experiments evaluate and analyze the performance of diverse GPU instances of the matrix-free CG solver.},

  Abstract                 = {The PARSIFAL (Probabilistic Approach to pRovide Scenarios of earthquake-Induced slope FAiLures) approach was applied in the basin of Alcoy (Alicante, South Spain), to provide a comprehensive scenario of earthquake-induced landslides. The basin of Alcoy is well known for several historical landslides, mainly represented by earth-slides, that involve urban settlement as well as infrastructures (i.e., roads, bridges). The PARSIFAL overcomes several limits existing in other approaches, allowing the concomitant analyses of: (i) first-time landslides (due to both rock-slope failures and shallow earth-slides) and reactivations of existing landslides; (ii) slope stability analyses of different failure mechanisms; (iii) comprehensive mapping of earthquake-induced landslide scenarios in terms of exceedance probability of critical threshold values of co-seismic displacements. Geotechnical data were used to constrain the slope stability analysis, while specific field surveys were carried out to measure jointing and strength conditions of rock masses and to inventory already existing landslides. GIS-based susceptibility analyses were performed to assess the proneness to shallow earth-slides as well as to verify kinematic compatibility to planar or wedge rock-slides and to topples. The experienced application of PARSIFAL to the Alcoy basin: (i) confirms the suitability of the approach at a municipality scale, (ii) outputs the main role of saturation in conditioning slope instabilities in this case study, (iii) demonstrates the reliability of the obtained results respect to the historical data.},

This directional dependence is considered to be the result of 2-D basin structure. In this study, we observed microtremors around a strong motion observation site of the Port and Harbor Research Institute in Onahama, Japan, and found that directional dependence of MHVRs exists in some parts of the area around the site. The directional dependence is more apparent and has a higher dominant frequency, at around 5 Hz, relative to those observed in Uji, at around 0.5 Hz. We defined a parameter $\gamma$, which we refer to as the ``directionally dependent coefficient'' to indicate the magnitude of difference between the two orthogonal components which implies the directional dependence of the MHVRs. We rotated the axes and calculated $\gamma$ for each angle and searched for the orientation that gave the largest $\gamma$ at a point. Points for which the axis with larger MHVR amplitude among the two axes is oriented in the NS direction are aligned in the NS direction, while points for which the axis with larger MHVR amplitude is oriented in the EW direction are aligned in the EW direction. The distribution of points with large $\gamma$ formed a T-shaped distribution. We calculated the analytical and numerical MHVRs in order to simulate the observed MHVRs and succeeded in showing the existence of a narrow wedge. From these results, we conclude that a wedge-like lateral heterogeneity exists in the shallow subsurface of the studied area, parallel to the direction of the axis of the larger MHVR amplitude.

  Abstract                 = {In this study we present a characteristic kinematic rupture model for an intraslab earthquake of the type of the 2001 Geiyo earthquake. The procedure for developing the characteristic rupture model follows the recipe developed by Irikura and Miyake (Proceedings of the 8th US National Conference on Earthquake Engineering, San Francisco, 2006) with a few modifications. We used the functional form of Nakamura and Miyatake [Zisin (J Seism Soc Jpn), 53, 1--9, 2000] to model the spatial and temporal variability of the slip rate function. In our procedure the earthquake source is specified by the kinematic description of the fault model that incorporates spatial heterogeneity in slip and rise time and constant rupture velocity. In the proposed characteristic model the asperity locations and rupture initiation point were the only parameters that were constrained by the available earthquake rupture models of the target earthquake. The quality of the characteristic rupture model was assessed by comparing recorded and synthetic ground motion time histories from the 2001 Geiyo earthquake calculated with a standard broadband (0.1--10 Hz) ground motion simulation technique. Our analyses show that the characteristic rupture model performs well in reproducing the recorded ground motion, in spite of its simple representation of the fault geometry and kinematic rupture complexity. The analyses of ground motion sensitivity to relative location of asperities, and their stress drop contrast suggest that the overall ground motion goodness of fit remains the same at short periods, but decreases slightly at periods longer than 1 s. We suspect that, due to the depth of the intraslab source (40--50 km), the higher-frequency ground motions are relatively insensitive to the details of the slip distribution and slip contrast. On the other hand, even for intraslab events, the lower-frequency motions are influenced by rupture directivity effects and slip distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work a fully explicit partitioned method for the simulation of Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems is presented. The fluid domain is modelled with an explicit Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) based on the hypothesis of weak compressibility. The Lagrangian description of the fluid is particularly effective in the simulation of FSI problems with free surface flows and large structural displacements, since the fluid boundaries are automatically defined by the position of the mesh nodes. A distinctive feature of the proposed FSI strategy is that the solid domain is modelled using the explicit integration Finite Element Method (FEM) in a off-the-shelf commercial software (Abaqus/Explicit). This allows to perform simulations with a complete and advanced description on the structural domain, including advanced structural material models and contact. The structure-to-fluid coupling algorithm is based on a technique derived from the Domain Decomposition Methods, namely the Gravouil and Combescure (GC) algorithm. The method allows for arbitrarily large interface displacements using different time incrementation and non-conforming meshes in the different domains, which is an essential feature for the efficiency of an explicit solver involving different materials. The resulting fully explicit and fully lagrangian finite element approach is particularly appealing for the possibility of its efficient application in a large variety of highly nonlinear engineering problems.

  abstract  = {The amount of energy released as a large fault ruptures provides some clues about the overall size of an earthquake. Meier et al. looked at this energy release for more than 100 large earthquakes. Although the overall size of an earthquake cannot be predicted from the rate of energy release, a minimum size can be estimated. Estimating this minimum size could add valuable seconds to early earthquake warning algorithms, helping to avoid damage and save people from injury or death.Science, this issue p. 1277The largest observed earthquakes occur on subduction interfaces and frequently cause widespread damage and loss of life. Understanding the rupture behavior of megathrust events is crucial for earthquake rupture physics, as well as for earthquake early-warning systems. However, the large variability in behavior between individual events seemingly defies a description with a simple unifying model. Here we use three source time function (STF) data sets for subduction zone earthquakes, with moment magnitude Mw >= 7, and show that such large ruptures share a typical universal behavior. The median STF is scalable between events with different sizes, grows linearly, and is nearly triangular. The deviations from the median behavior are multiplicative and Gaussian{\textemdash}that is, they are proportionally larger for larger events. Our observations suggest that earthquake magnitudes cannot be predicted from the characteristics of rupture onsets.},

  Abstract                 = {The main motivation for this study was the impending occurrence of a catastrophic earthquake along the Prince Island Fault (PIF) in the Marmara Sea and the disaster risk around the Marmara region, especially in Istanbul. This study provides the results of a physically based probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) methodology, using broadband strong ground motion simulations, for sites within the Marmara region, Turkey, that may be vulnerable to possible large earthquakes throughout the PIF segments in the Marmara Sea. The methodology is called physically based because it depends on the physical processes of earthquake rupture and wave propagation to simulate earthquake ground motion time histories. We included the effects of all considerable-magnitude earthquakes. To generate the high-frequency (0.5--20 Hz) part of the broadband earthquake simulation, real, small-magnitude earthquakes recorded by a local seismic array were used as empirical Green's functions. For the frequencies below 0.5 Hz, the simulations were obtained by using synthetic Green's functions, which are synthetic seismograms calculated by an explicit 2D/3D elastic finite difference wave propagation routine. By using a range of rupture scenarios for all considerable-magnitude earthquakes throughout the PIF segments, we produced a hazard calculation for frequencies of 0.1--20 Hz. The physically based PSHA used here followed the same procedure as conventional PSHA, except that conventional PSHA utilizes point sources or a series of point sources to represent earthquakes, and this approach utilizes the full rupture of earthquakes along faults. Furthermore, conventional PSHA predicts ground motion parameters by using empirical attenuation relationships, whereas this approach calculates synthetic seismograms for all magnitudes of earthquakes to obtain ground motion parameters. PSHA results were produced for 2, 10, and 50 {\%} hazards for all sites studied in the Marmara region.},

The resulting dynamics follows the path of steepest entropy ascent compatible with the constraints. The rate equation is consistent with the Onsager theorem of reciprocity and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The mathematical formalism was originally developed to obtain a quantum theoretical unification of mechanics and thermodinamics. It is presented here in a general, non-quantal formulation as a part of an effort to develop tools for the phenomenological treatment of non-equilibrium problems with applications in engineering, biology, sociology, and economics. The rate equation is also extended to include the case of assigned time-dependences of the constraints and the entropy, such as for modeling non-equilibrium energy and entropy exchanges.},

  Abstract                 = {We estimate strong motion generation areas that reproduce near-source ground motions in a broadband frequency range (0.2-10 Hz) using the empirical Green's function technique. The strong motion generation areas are defined as extended areas with relatively large slip velocities within a total rupture area. Four M 6 class (the 1997 Kagoshima on March and May, 1997 Yamaguchi, and 1998 Iwate) and several moderate-size earthquakes in Japan were analyzed. We examine the relationship between the strong motion generation area and the area of asperities, which is characterized based on heterogeneous slip distributions estimated from low-frequency (<1 Hz) waveform inversions (Somerville et al., 1999). We performed waveform fitting in acceleration, velocity, and displacement, then obtained the strong motion generation area occupying about a quarter of the total rupture area. The size and position of the strong motion generation area coincide with those of characterized asperities. We find self-similar scaling of seismic moment to both the size of the strong motion generation area and the rise time for a magnitude range of analyzed earthquakes. Based on our results, we propose a characterized source model for the broadband ground-motion simulation, which consists of strong motion generation areas with large slip velocities and a background slip area with a small slip velocity. Waveform modeling of the characterized source model suggests that the strong motion generation areas play important roles in simulating broadband ground motions and have the potential to be an about 10-MPa stress-release area on the fault.},

  Abstract                 = {Alluvial valleys generate strong effects on earthquake ground motion (EGM). These effects are rarely accounted for even in site-specific studies because of (a) the cost of the required geophysical surveys to constrain the site model, (b) lack of data for empirical prediction, and (c) poor knowledge of the key controlling parameters. We performed 3D, 2D and 1D simulations for six typical sedimentary valleys of various width and depth, and for a variety of modifications of these 6 ``nominal models'' to investigate sensitivity of EGM characteristics to impedance contrast, attenuation, velocity gradient and geometry. We calculated amplification factors, and 2D/1D and 3D/2D aggravation factors for 10 EGM characteristics, using a representative set of recorded accelerograms to account for input motion variability. The largest values of the amplification and aggravation factors are found for the Arias intensity and cumulative absolute velocity, the lowest for the root-mean-square acceleration. The aggravation factors are largest for the vertical component. For each model, at least one EGM characteristic exhibits a significant 2D/1D aggravation factor, while all EGM characteristics exhibit significant 2D/1D aggravation factor on the vertical component. For all investigated sites, there is always an area in the valley for which 1D estimates are not sufficient. 2D estimates are insufficient at several sites. The key structural parameters are the shape ratio and overall geometry of the sediment-bedrock interface, impedance contrast at the sediment-bedrock interface, and attenuation in sediments. The amplification factors may largely exceed the values that are usually considered in GMPEs between soft soils and rock sites.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we briefly address the consistency of formulations for nested surfaces plasticity and their kinematic hardening translation rules. Some requirements for these formulations are then given. It is shown and discussed that multilayer plasticity based on nested yield surfaces present some inconveniences when modelling multiaxial cyclic loading. On the other hand, the use of hardening surfaces, instead of yield surfaces solves the problem partially. It is also shown that multilayer plasticity based on the Mr{\'{o}}z kinematic rule yields clearly different multiaxial predictions when using the same uniaxial bilinear curve and different number of surfaces, which is a priori inconsistent since the same monotonic stress-strain curve should not result into a clearly different multiaxial behavior simply because of the discretization employed by the filippo. It is demonstrated that, in contrast with the Mr{\'{o}}z translation rule, multilayer plasticity using the Prager translation rule results in the same prediction regardless of the number of surfaces in which the hardening part of the bilinear curve is discretized. This rule is also compliant with the principle of maximum dissipation. It also allows for a vanishing elastic region without falling into theoretical or numerical difficulties. Hence, it should not be discarded when developing advanced models. {\copyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {A time domain polarization filter, originally proposed by Flinn, has been modified and is used to increase the signal to noise ratio of teleseismic body phases. Both the rectilinearity and direction of particle motion is obtained from the co-variance matrix for three components of ground motion over a small time interval. The estimate of rectilinearity is found by diagonalizing the matrix and forming a function that involves the ratio of the largest and intermediate principle axes of the matrix. The direction of polarization is found from the eigenvector of the largest principle axis. A set of time-varying operators are then obtained which act as a point by point gain control to modulate the digital seismic records. This non-linear filter is useful for enhancing P, pP, sP, PP, S and other compressional or shear phases. When applied to an array of three-component stations it appears to be possible to identify multiple events in the source function of some earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {The Central and Eastern United States (CEUS) has experienced an abnormal increase in seismic activity, which is believed to be related to anthropogenic activities. The U.S. Geological Survey has acknowledged this situation and developed the CEUS 2016 1 year seismic hazard model using the catalog of 2015 by assuming stationary seismicity in that period. However, due to the nonstationary nature of induced seismicity, it is essential to identify change points for accurate probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). We present a Bayesian procedure to identify the most probable change points in seismicity and define their respective seismic rates. It uses prior distributions in agreement with conventional PSHA and updates them with recent data to identify seismicity changes. It can determine the change points in a regional scale and may incorporate different types of information in an objective manner. It is first successfully tested with simulated data, and then it is used to evaluate Oklahoma's regional seismicity.},

  Abstract                 = {Modelling the scattering of guided waves by defects in three dimensions (3D) can be challenging. The most popular way to achieve this is the finite element (FE) method, at the cost of high computational load, which generally leads to a compromise between the accuracy of the results and the computational time, even when the geometry of the scatterer is simple. In this paper, we describe a procedure aimed at calculating the scattering matrix of an irregular defect in the most efficient way. The use of a frequency domain hybrid model which combines the flexibility of FE modelling and the efficiency of an integral representation of the acoustic fields allows very accurate results to be obtained with low computational load. The modelling procedure that we propose includes optimization of the size of the absorbing region and that of the mesh elements, minimization of number of incident directions, and the study of a spatial filter to smooth the geometry of the defect prior to meshing. Finally, the scattering matrix of a representative example of an irregular corrosion patch is calculated using the optimized procedure. Energy balance criteria are implemented to check the accuracy of the results.},

  Abstract                 = {The 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-Oki earthquake occurred on July 16, 2007 with a magnitude of 6.8. Immediately after the mainshock, a dense network of ocean-bottom seismometers and temporary land seismic stations were deployed to obtain the accurate aftershock location. A seismic survey using ocean-bottom seismometers, land stations and controlled sources at sea and on land was also conducted along three profiles to estimate the detailed velocity structure of the source region. A thick sedimentary layer covers the crust, and this layer is thickest near the coast. The upper crust has a P-wave velocity of 6. km/s and a large lateral heterogeneity with respect to thickness and velocity. The lower crust, with P-wave velocity of 7. km/s, has a thickness of approximately 10. km. The thickness of the crust is estimated to be approximately 24. km. The precise aftershock distribution was obtained by using the high-resolution velocity structure. The aftershocks in the upper crust form a plane dipping to the southeast. Most of the aftershocks are located in the upper crust; in addition, a small number of aftershocks in the lower crust seem to be positioned on the same plane formed by the aftershocks in the upper crust. The mainshock fault estimated from the aftershock distribution is positioned in the high-velocity body of the upper crust. A large deformation of the sediments above the epicentral region is interpreted to be due to the repeated occurrence of large earthquakes. The lower crust immediately below the fault has low velocity. The source region of the 2007 event in the upper crust is sandwiched by a weakening structure. We suggest that the ductile deformation of both the sediments and the lower crust causes stress accumulation in the source region. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Application of deconvolution interferometry to earthquake data recorded inside a building is a powerful technique for monitoring parameters of the building, such as velocities of traveling waves, frequencies of normal modes, and intrinsic attenuation. In this study, we apply interferometry to ambient-vibration data, instead of using earthquake data, to monitor a building. The time continuity of ambient vibrations is useful for temporal monitoring.We show that, because multiple sources simultaneously excite vibrations inside the building, the deconvolved waveforms obtained from ambient vibrations are nonzero for both positive and negative times, unlike the purely causal waveforms obtained from earthquake data. We develop a string model to qualitatively interpret the deconvolved waveforms. Using the synthetic waveforms, we find the traveling waves obtained from ambient vibrations propagate with the correct velocity of the building, and the amplitude decay of the deconvolved waveforms depends on both intrinsic attenuation and ground coupling. The velocities estimated from ambient vibrations are more stable than those computed from earthquake data. Because the acceleration of the observed earthquake records varies depending on the strength of the earthquakes and the distance from the hypocenter, the velocities estimated from earthquake data vary because of the nonlinear response of the building. From ambient vibrations, we extract the wave velocity due to the linear response of the building.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Free vibration measurements provide useful information in performing modal identification of civil infrastructure. Free vibration tests have been carried out frequently, because of the simple implementation and the availability of well‐established pre/postprocessing techniques. In particular, the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) can be used with free vibration data to extract modal information in a straightforward and automatic manner. However, using free vibration data with the ERA is often problematic for civil infrastructure, because of the significant noise in the measurements caused primarily by small vibration amplitudes and higher structural damping. To address this problem, a method for generating ERA input is proposed that reduces the effect of noise in measured free vibration data. The proposed method is an extension of the natural excitation technique developed for stationary random vibration signals. The natural excitation technique method is adjusted to accommodate free vibration data by replacing the cross‐correlations of stationary random processes with the temporal cross‐correlations of free vibration signals. Then, an approach to reduce the noise effect in the temporal cross‐correlations is proposed based on linear superposition of the cross power spectrum densities of overlapping data segments. Finally, results of the ERA using the proposed approach are compared with the corresponding results from directly applying ERA to the free vibration data. The comparisons using numerical and field test data show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional approach, especially for the modes whose amplitudes are small in the measured free vibration signals.},

  Abstract                 = {In an earthquake, the earth moves in a nearly random fashion in all directions, both horizontally and vertically. Measurements have been made of earthquake motions in a number of instances. In general, those measurements which are of greatest interest are the records of' strong motion' earthquake accelerations, measured by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for a number of earthquakes in California in the past three decades. These accelera- tions, as a function of time, are available for motion in two horizontal directions as well as in the vertical direction, at a number of locations for several earthquakes. From the time- record of the acceleration, the velocities and displacements can be computed by integration. One of the most intense strong motion records available is that for the El Centro, Cali- fornia earthquake of 18 May, 1940. The record for the north-south component of acceleration of this earthquake is shown in Fig. 1, which also shows the values computed for velocity and displacement in the same direction. From the figure it can be observed that the maximum ground acceleration in the direction of this measurement is about 0$\cdot$32 g, the maximum ground velocity 13$\cdot$7 in/sec, and the maximum ground displacement 8$\cdot$3 in. The general nature of earthquake motions is indicated by this figure. It can be noted that the highest intensity peaks of acceleration have a relatively short period or a relatively high frequency; the most important peaks in the velocity, however, have a longer period which corresponds to a lower frequency; and the important peaks in the ground displacement have a much longer period still. For the ground conditions at El Centro the length of single loops of the highest intensities, in the various records, have durations of the order of the follow- ing: for acceleration, about 0$\cdot$ 1 to 0$\cdot$5 sec; for velocity, about 0$\cdot$3 to 2 sec; and for displacement about 1 to 4 sec. In other types of soil, the relative durations may differ, with softer soils in general showing lower magnitudes of acceleration, but longer durations and much larger displacements, than in Fig. 1. It must be remembered that the El Centro earthquake is not the largest earthquake which has been experienced, even in California. It happened only to yield the most intense record at a point where a strong motion accelerograph was located.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work a Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMR) algorithm is used to calculate local magnitude (Ml) using only five seconds of signal after the P wave onset of one three component seismic station. This algorithm was trained with 863 records of historical earthquakes, where the input regression parameters were an exponential function of the waveform envelope estimated by least squares and the maximum value of the observed waveform for each component in a single station. Ten-fold cross validation was applied for a normalized polynomial kernel obtaining the mean absolute error for different exponents and complexity parameters. The local magnitude (Ml) could be estimated with 0.19 units of mean absolute error. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement in hardware and may be used directly after the field seismological sensor to generate fast decisions at seismological control centers, increasing the possibility of having an effective reaction.},

  Abstract                 = {An accuracy analysis of a new class of integration algorithms for finite deformation elastoplastic constitutive relations recently proposed by the authors, is carried out in this paper. For simplicity, attention is confined to infinitesimal deformations. The integration rules under consideration fall within the category of return mapping algorithms and follow in a straightforward manner from the theory of operator splitting applied to elastoplastic constitutive relations. General rate-independent and rate-dependent behaviour, with plastic hardening or softening, associated or non-associated flow rules and nonlinear elastic response can be efficiently treated within the present framework. Isoerror maps are presented which demonstrate the good accuracy properties of the algorithm even for strain increments much larger than the characteristic strains at yielding.},

The interferogram generated from descending data revealed a slant-range shortening exceeding 20 cm in the coastal area of Kashiwazaki adjacent to the epicenter and a maximum slant range extension of approximately 15 cm southeast of the slant-range shortening pattern. The interferogram generated from descending data is consistent with GPS displacements, but the non-crustal deformation component was large in the interferogram generated from ascending data. Based on a fault plane dipping to the southeast, a fault-slip distribution was estimated from the descending interferogram and GPS displacements. The largest fault-slip was located in the southwestern deeper part of the mainshock hypocenter. In the northern part of the focal region, the fault-slip was dominant at depths of 5-15 km, but it Was limited to shallower depths in the Southern part of the focal region. Such fault-slip distribution is consistent with the aftershock distribution. This consistency Supports the assumption that the fault rupture in the mainshock has primarily occurred in the nodal plane dipping to the southeast.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of porosity and void size on effective elastic geotechnical engineering properties with a 3D model of random fields and finite element. The random field theory is used to generate models of geomaterials containing spatially random voids with controlled porosity and void size. A "tied freedom" analysis is developed to evaluate the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in an ideal block material of finite elements. To deliver a mean and standard deviation of the elastic parameters, this approach uses Monte-Carlo simulations and finite elements, where each simulation leads to an effective value of the property under investigation. The results are extended to investigate an influence of representative volume element (RVE). A comparison of the effective elastic stiffness of 2D and 3D models is also discussed. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The large volume of high-resolution images acquired by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has opened a new frontier for developing automated approaches to detecting landforms on the surface of Mars. However, most landform classifiers focus on crater detection, which represents only one of many geological landforms of scientific interest. In this work, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) to detect both volcanic rootless cones and transverse aeolian ridges. Our system, named MarsNet, consists of five networks, each of which is trained to detect landforms of different sizes. We compare our detection algorithm with a widely used method for image recognition, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. We show that ConvNets can detect a wide range of landforms and has better accuracy and recall in testing data than traditional classifiers based on SVMs.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACTThis paper describes the construction of a stochastic model of urban railway track geometry irregularities, based on experimental data. The considered irregularities are track gauge, superelevation, horizontal and vertical curvatures. They are modelled as random fields whose statistical properties are extracted from a large set of on-track measurements of the geometry of an urban railway network. About 300–1000 terms are used in the Karhunen–Loève/Polynomial Chaos expansions to represent the random fields with appropriate accuracy. The construction of the random fields is then validated by comparing on-track measurements of the contact forces and numerical dynamics simulations for different operational conditions (train velocity and car load) and horizontal layouts (alignment, curve). The dynamics simulations are performed both with and without randomly generated geometrical irregularities for the track. The power spectrum densities obtained from the dynamics simulations with the model of geometrical irregularities compare extremely well with those obtained from the experimental contact forces. Without irregularities, the spectrum is 10–50 dB too low. },

Iterations are performed to ensure that admissible values of foundation rotations are complied with, in addition to the standard checks on structural displacements and drifts. Some examples of application of the approach to the design of bridge piers are provided.

A simplified approach for modelling the seismic behaviour of the shallow foundation is then introduced. This consists in modelling the whole soil-foundation system with a three-degrees- of-freedom nonlinear macro-element. Two constitutive laws with different degrees of complexity are employed. The remarkable agreement achieved with observations demonstrates the reliability of the proposed models an their potential applications to performance-based design approaches, where the foundation yielding may play a relevant role in the determination of seismic actions on the superstructure.

  Abstract                 = { Two methods are illustrated to effectively calculate the ground motion induced by constant speed moving loads. On the one hand, the dynamic Betti–Rayleigh reciprocity theorem allows one to take full advantage of the availability of Green’s functions for a homogeneous or a horizontally layered half-space. On the other hand, the spectral element method allows one to deal with complicated configurations, including dynamic soil-structure interaction, with an accuracy that is significantly higher than classical finite element or finite difference methods. Both the Betti–Rayleigh and spectral element methods are considered in three dimensions. After validating both methods, the decay of peak ground motion with distance is analyzed as a function of load speed and frequency. For speeds lower than the Rayleigh wave velocity in the soil, the decay turns out to be much faster than for a stationary point load. This effect is studied in detail by an analytical approach and interpreted in terms of destructive interference. Finally, the previous analytical and numerical results are checked against the records obtained at Ath, Belgium, during a field experiment to study ground motion induced by high-speed trains in soft soil conditions. },

In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is represented as a high-order Lagrangian interpolant through Chebyshev collocation points. The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion. Comparisons are made with experiment and previous numerical work.},

As an example, time-dependent nonlinear soil behavior was estimated in vertical components of records obtained in the epicentral area of the 1995 Kobe earthquake. Degradation of the rigidity of soils in the strong motion was observed. The constructed nonlinear models of the soil behavior were used for estimating the nonlinear parts in the ground response by the nonlinear system identification technique. Nonlinear parts in the ground response were found to be as high as $\sim$50{\%} at 2 km from the fault and $\sim$10{\%} at 6-15 km from the fault plane. Odd types of nonlinearity, such as cubic, the fifth, seventh, etc. order, were found to be typical for soils, whereas, nonlinearities of even types are usually weak, but increase in liquefied soils.},

Corresponding axes are defined which yield maximum values for the covariances. The orthogonal transformations involved are identical in form to those used in the transformation of stress. Examination of real accelerograms reveals that the major principal axis points in the general direction of the epicentre and the minor principal axis is nearly vertical. It is concluded that artificially generated components of ground motion need not be correlated statistically provided they are directed along a set of principal axes.},

The proposed methodology simultaneously takes into account multi-fidelity in models, such as direct numerical simulations versus empirical formulae, as well as multi-fidelity in the probability space (e.g. sparse grids versus tensor product multi-element probabilistic collocation). We are able to construct response surfaces of complex dynamical systems by blending multiple information sources via auto-regressive stochastic modelling. A computationally efficient machine learning framework is developed based on multi-level recursive co-kriging with sparse precision matrices of Gaussian{\textendash}Markov random fields. The effectiveness of the new algorithms is demonstrated in numerical examples involving a prototype problem in risk-averse design, regression of random functions, as well as uncertainty quantification in fluid mechanics involving the evolution of a Burgers equation from a random initial state, and random laminar wakes behind circular cylinders.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements and observations of ground shaking during large earthquakes have demonstrated the predominant role of site effects in the response of infrastructure during a seismic event. Despite significant efforts to model the hysteretic response and nonlinearity of soils due to medium and large ground motions, the most widely accepted nonlinear site response methods are not able to represent simultaneously the changes of stiffness and energy dissipation (damping) observed in both laboratory tests and during earthquake events. This paper presents two new soil damping formulations implemented in nonlinear one-dimensional site response analysis for small and large strains. The first formulation introduces an approach to construct a frequency-independent viscous damping matrix which reduces the over-damping at high frequencies, and therefore, the filtering at those frequencies. The second formulation introduces a reduction factor that modifies the extended Masing loading/unloading strain-stress relationship to match measured modulus reduction and damping curves simultaneously over a wide range of shear strains. A set of examples are introduced to illustrate the effect of using the two proposed formulations, separately and simultaneously, in nonlinear site response analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {The rapid decrease of the acceleration spectral amplitude at high frequencies has widely been modeled by the spectral decay factor kappa ($\kappa$). Usually, the path-corrected component of $\kappa$, often called $\kappa$0, is believed to be a local and frequency-independent site characteristic, in turn representing attenuation related to waves propagating vertically through the very shallow layers beneath the study site. Despite the known relevance of $\kappa$0 in a wide range of seismological applications, most methods for its calculation do not fully consider the influence of the scattering component. To account for the scattering component, we present a summary of statistical observations of the seismic wavefield at sites of the Swiss seismic networks. The intrinsic properties of the wavefield show a clear dependency on the local shallow subsoil conditions with differences in the structural heterogeneity of the shallow subsoil layers producing different scattering regimes. Such deviations from the ballistic behavior (i.e., direct waves that sample only distinct directions) are indicative for local structural heterogeneities and the associated level of scatter. Albeit the attenuation term related to scattering depends nonlinearly on the intrinsic term, the results indicate that the commonly used explanation for the high-frequency decay spectrum might not be appropriate but involving the amount of scattering might allow better constrained estimates of $\kappa$0.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In order to conquer the spurious reflections from the truncated edges and maintain the stability in the long-time simulation of elastic wave propagation, several perfectly matched layer (PML) methods have been proposed in the first-order (e.g., velocity–stress equations) and the second-order (e.g., energy equation with displacement unknown only) formulations. The multiaxial perfectly matched layer (M-PML) holds the excellent stability for the long-time simulation of wave propagation, even though it is not perfectly matched in the discretized M-PML equation system. This absorbing boundary approach can offer an alternative way to solve the problem of the late-time instability, especially for anisotropic media, which is also suffered by the convolutional perfectly matched layer (C-PML) that is supposed to be competent to handle most stable problems. The M-PML termination implementation in the first-order formulations is well proposed. The common drawback of the implementation of the first-order M-PML formulations is that it necessitates fundamental reconstruction of the existing codes of the second-order spectral element method (SEM) or finite element method (FEM). Therefore, we propose a nonconvolutional second-order M-PML absorbing boundary condition approach for the wave propagation simulation in elastic media that has not yet been developed before. Two-dimensional numerical simulation validations demonstrate that the proposed second-order M-PML has good performances: 1) superior efficiency and stability of absorbing the spurious elastic wavefields, both the surface waves and body waves, reflected on the boundaries; 2) superior stability in the long-time simulation even in the isotropic medium with a high Poisson's ratio; 3) superior efficiency and stability in the long-time simulation for anisotropic media. This method hence makes the SEM and FEM in the second-order wave equation formulation more efficient and stable for the long-time simulation.},

An overview is made of the main characteristics of soil behaviour in cyclic loading conditions. The models are then analysed and evaluated in light of these characteristics. The models are described and tested in Plaxis for a simple cyclic loading scenario, and some remarks are made about their ability to simulate the desired behaviour and their field of application. A new model is developed, based on a non-linear elastic stress-strain relationship, that, given mod- ulus and damping experimental results, generates and adapts a spline backbone curve in stress-strain space so that the resulting analytical curves are as close as possible to both sets of experimental results. The development of the new constitutive soil model is explained and tested in its ability to approximate experimental data, and its implementation into Plaxis is similarly evaluated. Finally, both the existing tested models and the developed model are subjected an earthquake sim- ulation in Plaxis. The results obtained from the model are compared with each other, with measured ground motion records and with a simulation using the EERA program, and considerations are made about the performance of each model.

  Abstract                 = {Stiffness degradation and damping represent some of the most well-known aspects of cyclic soil behavior. While standard equivalent linear approaches reproduce these features by (separately) prescribing stiffness reduction and damping curves, in this paper a multiaxial, 3D, viscoelastic - plastic model is developed for the simultaneous simulation of both cyclic curves over a wide cyclic shear strain range. The proposed constitutive relationship is based on two parallel resisting/dissipative mechanisms, purely frictional (elastic-plastic) and viscous. The frictional mechanism is formulated as a bounding surface plasticity model with vanishing elastic domain, including pressure-sensitive failure locus and non-associative plastic flow - which are essential for effective stress analysis. At the same time, the use of the parallel viscous mechanism is shown to be especially beneficial to improve the simulation of the overall dissipative performance.In order to enable model calibration from stiffness degradation (G / G max) and damping curves, the constitutive equations are purposely kept as simple as possible with a low number of material parameters. Although the model performance is here explored with reference to pure shear cyclic tests, the 3D, multiaxial formulation is appropriate for general loading conditions. {\copyright} 2014.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper tackles the numerical simulation of 1D wave propagation in saturated viscous porous media, and especially in soil-like geomaterials. For this purpose, an improved fractional step Taylor-Galerkin algorithm is first formulated and then validated on the basis of a new analytical solution.The algorithm, based on a stress-velocity-pressure formulation of the hydro-mechanical problem, combines an explicit Taylor-Galerkin method with a fractional time-stepping, while an accurate Runge-Kutta-type integrator is introduced to treat the viscosity of the porous skeleton. The overall algorithm results in an efficient stabilized scheme allowing for linear equal interpolation of field variables, even when the so-called "undrained incompressible limit" is approached.The accuracy and stability of the method are verified with reference to a 1D benchmark problem, concerning the propagation of P waves along a saturated viscoelastic soil stratum. For this problem, a frequency-domain analytical solution is derived, assuming incompressible interstitial fluid and soil grains. The assumption of Maxwell viscoelastic soil skeleton is analytically convenient to preserve the linearity of the problem, while the same rheology of a more realistic elasto-viscoplastic non-linear behaviour is maintained.The performance of the fractional step Taylor-Galerkin algorithm is explored simulating the dynamic response of the stratum to harmonic, impulsive and seismic input excitations. In particular, parametric analyses are performed to confirm the effectiveness of the method in reproducing fully undrained responses, as well as in dealing with weakly viscous materials. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {The 17 January 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu earthquake is a typical example showing that the ground motions along basin-edge faults can be very destructive. In this study, we simulate the near-fault ground motion from this earthquake based on a kinematic fault model and a simplified 3D velocity structure of the Kobe area. The kinematic earthquake rupture and the wave propagation are modeled using a 3D finite-difference method (FDM). Our simulation identifies the basin-edge effect as an important factor that influenced the ground-motion amplification pattern in the Kobe area. We found that the coupling of the source directivity and basin-edge effects causes impulsive ground motions with extremely high amplitude at periods greater than 1 sec and in a narrow zone offset less than 1 km from the basin edge. The combination of these effects acted to create a fairly continuous band of amplification that extends about 30 km in an elongated zone parallel to the basin-edge boundary. In some areas, localized site effects might have been as important as the abovementioned effects, but they cannot explain the continuity of the extended east-west zone of damage.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines the effect of random heterogeneity of soil properties on bearing capacity. The stochastic soil property considered is the undrained shear strength and two major sources of uncertainty are identified with it: inherent spatial variability (modeled as a non-Gaussian, homogeneous stochastic field) and uncertainty in the estimation of its expected value (modeled as a random variable). The two sources of uncertainty are treated separately, before being eventually combined. A Monte Carlo simulation approach is followed in combination with non-linear finite element analysis. It is demonstrated that the inherent spatial variability of soil shear strength can drastically modify the basic form of the failure mechanism in this bearing capacity problem. Consequently, there is no 'average' failure mechanism (surface) in this problem, leading to the conclusion that Monte Carlo simulation is the only methodology capable of providing a solution to this geomechanics problem. It is further demonstrated that this behavior of the failure mechanism translates into a substantial reduction in the ultimate bearing capacity (in an average sense), compared to the corresponding deterministic (homogeneous soil) case. In addition, differential settlements are computed in the stochastic analysis, something impossible in a deterministic analysis of a symmetric problem. A parametric study is performed using fragility curves to investigate the effects of various probabilistic parameters involved in the problem. It is found that the coefficient of variation and the marginal probability distribution of the soil's shear strength (both controlling the amount of loose pockets in the soil mass) are the two most important parameters in reducing the bearing capacity (in an average sense) and producing substantial differential settlements in heterogeneous soils (compared to homogeneous soils). A technique is finally introduced for determining 'overall' fragility curves that account for both inherent soil spatial variability and uncertainty in the expected value of soil strength. Based on such 'overall' fragility curves obtained at failure (ultimate bearing capacity), nominal values of the bearing capacity of a heterogeneous soil deposit corresponding to an exceedance probability of 5{\%} are established for a range of probabilistic characteristics. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {The proposed general analytical model describes the anisotropic, elasto-plastic, path-dependent, stress-strain-strength properties of inviscid saturated clays under undrained loading conditions. The model combines properties of isotropic and kinematic plasticity by introducing the concept of a field of plastic moduli which is defined in stress space by the relative configuration of yield surfaces. For any loading (or unloading) history, the instantaneous configuration is determined by calculating the translation and contraction (or expansion) of each yield surface. The stress-strain behaviour of clays can thus be determined for complex loading paths and in particular for cyclic loadings. The stress-strain relationships are provided for use in finite element analyses. The model parameters required to characterize the behaviour of any given clay can be derived entirely from conventional triaxial or simple shear soil test results. The model's extreme versatility is demonstrated by using it to formulate the behaviour of the Drammen clay under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The parameters are determined by using solely the results from monotonic and cyclic strain-controlled simple shear experimental tests, and the model's accuracy is evaluated by applying it to predict the results of other tests such as (1) cyclic stress-controlled simple shear tests, (2) monotonic triaxial loading compression and unloading extension tests, and (3) cyclic stress- and strain-controlled triaxial tests on, this same clay. The theoretical predictions are found to agree extremely well with the experimental test results.},

A series of load controlled triaxial tests, by imposing finite load increments, has been performed. The single load increments are followed by variable time periods, in order to carry out many classical creep tests. According to the authors, the considered time dependency is due to the internal fabric rearrangement of the granular assembly, i.e. to the plastic strain development with time. This mechanical peculiarity is theoretically interpreted by means of an elastoviscoplastic constitutive model. This is a very simple extension of a previous incremental elastoplastic constitutive model and appears to be capable to reproduce experimental data quite well.

  abstract  = {As is well known, granular soils under cyclic loading dissipate a large amount of energy and accumulate large irreversible strains. Usually, with time, this second effect reduces and the accumulation rate decreases with the number of cycles until obtaining a sort of ideal stationary cyclic state at which ratcheting disappears. In this paper, only this ideal state is taken into consideration and simulated by means of a multi-mechanism constitutive model for plastic adaptation. For this purpose, the concept of cycle is discussed, many different categories of cyclic stress/strain paths are considered and some theoretical issues concerning both the flow and the strain-hardening rules are tackled. Even though the paper focuses on soil behaviour, the conclusions can be extended to all materials exhibiting ratcheting due to volumetric behaviour.Copyright � 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {To investigate differences in the frictional behavior between initially bare rock surfaces of serpentinite and powdered serpentinite (?gouge?) at subseismic to seismic slip rates, we conducted single-velocity step and multiple-velocity step friction experiments on an antigorite-rich and lizardite-rich serpentinite at slip rates (V) from 0.003?m/s to 6.5?m/s, sliding displacements up to 1.6?m, and normal stresses (?n) up to 22?MPa for gouge and 97?MPa for bare surfaces. Nominal steady state friction values (?nss) in gouge at V?=?1?m/s are larger than in bare surfaces for all ?n tested and demonstrate a strong ?n dependence; ?nss decreased from 0.51 at 4.0?MPa to 0.39 at 22.4?MPa. Conversely, ?nss values for bare surfaces remained ~0.1 with increasing ?n and V. Additionally, the velocity at the onset of frictional weakening and the amount of slip prior to weakening were orders of magnitude larger in gouge than in bare surfaces. Extrapolation of the normal stress dependence for ?nss suggests that the behavior of antigorite gouge approaches that of bare surfaces at ?n???60?MPa. X-ray diffraction revealed dehydration reaction products in samples that frictionally weakened. Microstructural analysis revealed highly localized slip zones with melt-like textures in some cases gouge experiments and in all bare surfaces experiments for V???1?m/s. One-dimensional thermal modeling indicates that flash heating causes frictional weakening in both bare surfaces and gouge. Friction values for gouge decrease at higher velocities and after longer displacements than bare surfaces because strain is more distributed.},

A user-friendly web front-end allows the interactive use of a ``robust'' procedure (in the sense that it has been extensively tested), in order to select and process uncorrected waveforms from the ESM database, and derive several products: processed acceleration, velocity and displacement time series, as well as acceleration and displacement response spectra. The service is addressed to engineering seismologists, earthquake engineers, but also to students and professionals, if adequately trained.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents analytical solutions for the evolution of excess pore pressures in the vicinity of a shear band in a rate-dependent, strain-softening permeable soil, with the aim to explore, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the potential variation of failure shear stress in the shear band. The solutions encompass both dissipation of a pre-existing pore pressure regime within the main soil domain, and the effects of generation of additional pore pressure within the shear band itself. The simplified analytical solutions were checked by numerical inversion of exact solutions in Laplace transform space, confirming their high accuracy. The solutions show that it is possible for the failure shear stress to rise initially because of short-term dissipation of the pre-existing excess pore pressure at a faster rate than generation of new excess pore pressure within the shear band. This apparent strain hardening in a strain-softening soil can be misleading in that it can temporarily slow down the sliding mass and create a false sense of stabilization of the slope. It can also result in additional temporary shear resistance for sliding foundations or pipelines on the seabed. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {PREdiction of NOn‐LINear soil behavior (PRENOLIN) is an international benchmark aiming to test multiple numerical simulation codes that are capable of predicting nonlinear seismic site response with various constitutive models. One of the objectives of this project is the assessment of the uncertainties associated with nonlinear simulation of 1D site effects. A first verification phase (i.e., comparison between numerical codes on simple idealistic cases) will be followed by a validation phase, comparing the predictions of such numerical estimations with actual strong‐motion recordings obtained at well‐known sites. The benchmark presently involves 21 teams and 23 different computational codes.We present here the main results of the verification phase dealing with simple cases. Three different idealized soil profiles were tested over a wide range of shear strains with different input motions and different boundary conditions at the sediment/bedrock interface. A first iteration focusing on the elastic and viscoelastic cases was proved to be useful to ensure a common understanding and to identify numerical issues before pursuing the nonlinear modeling. Besides minor mistakes in the implementation of input parameters and output units, the initial discrepancies between the numerical results can be attributed to (1) different understanding of the expression “input motion” in different communities, and (2) different implementations of material damping and possible numerical energy dissipation. The second round of computations thus allowed a convergence of all teams to the Haskell–Thomson analytical solution in elastic and viscoelastic cases. For nonlinear computations, we investigate the epistemic uncertainties related only to wave propagation modeling using different nonlinear constitutive models. Such epistemic uncertainties are shown to increase with the strain level and to reach values around 0.2 (log10 scale) for a peak ground acceleration of 5  m/s2 at the base of the soil column, which may be reduced by almost 50% when the various constitutive models used the same shear strength and damping implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {We performed a suite of numerical simulations based on the 1811{\textendash}1812 New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) earthquakes, which demonstrate the importance of 3D geologic structure and rupture directivity on the ground-motion response throughout a broad region of the central United States (CUS) for these events. Our simulation set consists of 20 hypothetical earthquakes located along two faults associated with the current seismicity trends in the NMSZ. The hypothetical scenarios range in magnitude from M~7.0 to 7.7 and consider various epicenters, slip distributions, and rupture characterization approaches. The low-frequency component of our simulations was computed deterministically up to a frequency of 1~Hz using a regional 3D seismic velocity model and was combined with higher-frequency motions calculated for a 1D medium to generate broadband synthetics (0{\textendash}40~Hz in some cases). For strike-slip earthquakes located on the southwest{\textendash}northeast-striking NMSZ axial arm of seismicity, our simulations show 2{\textendash}10~s period energy channeling along the trend of the Reelfoot rift and focusing strong shaking northeast toward Paducah, Kentucky, and Evansville, Indiana, and southwest toward Little Rock, Arkansas. These waveguide effects are further accentuated by rupture directivity such that an event with a western epicenter creates strong amplification toward the northeast, whereas an eastern epicenter creates strong amplification toward the southwest. These effects are not as prevalent for simulations on the reverse-mechanism Reelfoot fault, and large peak ground velocities (\&gt;40 cm/s) are typically confined to the near-source region along the up-dip projection of the fault. Nonetheless, these basin response and rupture directivity effects have a significant impact on the pattern and level of the estimated intensities, which leads to additional uncertainty not previously considered in magnitude estimates of the 1811{\textendash}1812 sequence based only on historical reports.The region covered by our simulation domain encompasses a large portion of the CUS centered on the NMSZ, including several major metropolitan areas. Based on our simulations, more than eight million people living and working near the NMSZ would experience potentially damaging ground motion and modified Mercalli intensities ranging from VI to VIII if a repeat of the 1811{\textendash}1812 earthquakes occurred today. Moreover, the duration of strong ground shaking in the greater Memphis metropolitan area could last from 30 to more than 60~s, depending on the magnitude and epicenter.Online Material: Tables of 1D velocity models used to generate the high-frequency synthetics, and figures of source models and peak ground motion synthetics.},

  Abstract                 = {Frequency-based methods for measuring seismic attenuation are used commonly in exploration geophysics. To measure the spectrum of a nonstationary seismic signal, different methods are available, including transforms with time windows that are either fixed or systematically varying with the frequency being ana- lyzed. We compare four time-frequency transforms and show that the choice of a fixed- or variable-window transform affects the robustness and accuracy of the resulting attenuation measure- ments. For fixed-window transforms, we use the short-time Fou- rier transform and Gabor transform. The S-transform and contin- uous wavelet transform are analyzed as the variable-length trans- forms. First we conduct a synthetic transmission experiment, and compare the frequency-dependent scattering attenuation to the theoretically predicted values. From this procedure, we find that variable-window transforms reduce the uncertainty and bias of the resulting attenuation estimate, specifically at the upper and lower ends of the signal bandwidth. Our second experiment mea- sures attenuation from a zero-offset reflection synthetic using a linear regression of spectral ratios. Estimates for constant-Q at- tenuation obtained with the variable-window transforms depend less on the choice of regression bandwidth, resulting in a more precise attenuation estimate. These results are repeated in our analysis of surface seismic data, whereby we also find that the at- tenuation measurements made by variable-window transforms have a stronger match to their expected trend with offset. We con- clude that time-frequency transforms with a systematically vary- ing time window, such as the S-transform and continuous wave- let transform, allow for more robust estimates of seismic attenua- tion. Peaks and notches in the measured spectrum are reduced be- cause the analyzed primary signal is better isolated from the coda, and because of high-frequency spectral smoothing implicit in the use of short-analysis windows.},

In addition, the model obeys a general nonlinear kinematic hardening and an exponential isotropic hardening.Practical implications – Integrating the constitutive equations in order to update the material state is one of the most important steps in a nonlinear finite element analysis. The accuracy of the integration method could directly influence the result of the elastoplastic analyses.Originality/value – The paper deals with integrating the constitutive equations in a nonlinear finite element analysis. This subject could be interesting for the academy as well as industry. The proposed exponential‐based integration method is more efficient than the classical strategies. },

  Abstract                 = {The paper examines two aspects of the theory which treats localization of deformation as a bifurcation from homogeneous deformation. The results are obtained for solids modelled as elastic-plastic and having smooth yield and plastic potential surfaces, but it is not required that inelastic strain increments be normal to the yield surface. It is demonstrated that discontinuous bifurcations, for which elastic unloading occurs outside the zone of incipient localization, first become possible at the point of continuous bifurcation, for which further plastic deformation is assumed to occur both inside and outside of the zone of localization.},

  Abstract                 = {The rupture process occurring during an earthquake is described here in terms of one of the few known solutions to a problem of brittle fracture, in which rupture originates at a point, and spreads over a fault plane, initiating shearing motions. Using a stress-relaxation model with a particular geometry of rupture growth, stresses and displacements can readily be found throughout the medium in which rupture is taking place. The qualitative and quantitative properties of this fracture solution can give considerable assistance in interpreting records of strong ground motion, and provides insight into the processes taking place at an earthquake source. It is shown that rupture speeds are likely to lie between the Rayleigh-wave and shear-wave speeds, that temperatures can be raised substantially by faulting, and that the ratio of particle velocity to stress drop is approximately proportional to rupture velocity. In order to obtain the rupture velocity in rock mechanics experiments, measurement of displacement normal to the fracture surface is recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper focuses on a coupled Bayesian-Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) approach for the real-time identification and updating of numerical models. The purpose is to use the most general case of Bayesian inference theory in order to address inverse problems and to deal with different sources of uncertainties (measurement and model errors, stochastic parameters). In order to do so with a reasonable CPU cost, the idea is to replace the direct model called for Monte-Carlo sampling by a PGD reduced model, and in some cases directly compute the probability density functions from the obtained analytical formulation. This procedure is first applied to a welding control example with the updating of a deterministic parameter. In the second application, the identification of a stochastic parameter is studied through a glued assembly example.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the energy partitions among elastic waves due to dynamic normal and tangential surface loads in a semi-infinite elastic solid. While the results for a dynamic normal load on the surface of a half-space with Poisson ratio of 1/4 is a well-known result by Miller and Pursey (1955), the corresponding results for a dynamic tangential load are almost unknown. The partitions for the normal and tangential loads were computed independently by Weaver (1985) versus Poisson ratio (0 <= v <= 1/2), using diffuse-field concepts within the context of ultrasonic measurements. The connection with the surface load point was not explicit, which partially explains why these results did not reach the seismological and engineering literature. The characteristics of the elastic radiation of these two cases are quite different. For a normal load, about 2/3 of the energy leaves the loaded point as Rayleigh surface waves. On the other hand, the tangential load induces a similar amount in the form of body shear waves. It is established that the energies injected into the elastic half-space by concentrated normal and tangential harmonic surface loads are proportional to the imaginary part of the corresponding components of the Green's tensor when both source and receiver coincide. The relationship between the Green's function and average correlations of motions within a diffuse field is clearly established.},

  Abstract                 = {We simulated broadband hard-rock ground-motion time histories for the Saint Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area due to three large earthquakes (6.5 ≦ Mw ≦ 7.5), each occurring on the largest fault segment of the New Madrid fault zone at a distance of about 200 km. A deterministic procedure was implemented to simulate ground motion for frequencies less than 1 Hz for which the propagation effects were calculated using full-wave theory. For signals above 1 Hz, a semi-empirical simulation approach was used. The fault dimensions were defined in conformity with a constant stress-drop model developed for eastern North America; the fault width was constrained to a maximum depth of 16 km following the occurrence of the natural seismicity. For each event, we simulated broadband time histories for ten randomly generated slip models at eight sites distributed in various locations in the city of Saint Louis. This study shows that the level of peak ground motions at hard-rock sites in Saint Louis is small; the largest average peak horizontal ground-motion acceleration simulated is only 26.45 cm/sec2 (1.96 cm/sec for the velocity) even for the largest event. To validate the simulation results, we examined regional accelerograms and their peak values and response spectra recorded during the 25 November 1988 Saguenay earthquake (Mw = 5.8) at distances further than 230 km from its epicenter to be consistent with the distance of the city of Saint Louis from the New Madrid earthquake zone. The Saguenay earthquake observations seem consistent with simulation values obtained for the Mw = 6.5 New Madrid earthquake. A preliminary equivalent linear analysis by applying these simulated motions at the base of a soil profile suggests that the level of ground motions is too weak to produce damaging effects in Saint Louis even for the largest event on the longest segment.},

  Abstract                 = {The Niigata prefecture in Japan was devastated by a large shallow earthquake (M w 6.6, M JMA 6.8) on July 16, 2007. This earthquake has been recorded at 305 stations of Kiban Kyoshin network (KiK-net). Source model of this earthquake has been computed from accelerograms recorded by KiK-net at near-field stations surrounding source of earthquake. Several isolated wave packets were seen in recorded accelerograms at near-field stations surrounding source of this earthquake. Each wave packet in recorded accelerogram represents an isolated patch of envelope of accelerogram released from a rupture plane and is considered to be an independent source of strong motion generation area. Three different isolated wave packets have been identified within the rupture plane of the Niigata earthquake from recorded accelerograms. These isolated wave packets were considered as strong motion generation areas (SMGAs) in the rupture plane. Source parameters of each SMGA were calculated from the source displacement spectra. The approximate locations of SMGAs over the source fault were estimated using spatio-temporal variation of 48 aftershocks recorded by KiK-net and K-NET. Modified semi-empirical method has been used to simulate strong ground motion at various stations. Comparison of the observed and simulated acceleration waveforms is made in terms of root-mean-square error. Comparison of NS and EW component of observed and simulated records at eight stations confirms the suitability of final source model consisting of three SMGAs and efficacy of the modified semi-empirical technique to simulate strong ground motion.},

  Abstract                 = {The Knopoff-deHoop representation theorem has been used to calculate the form of the body waves radiated from an elliptical fault. Rupture is assumed to initiate at one focus of the ellipse and then spread out radially on the fault plane. Two cases are considered: 1) constant slip everywhere on the fault surface and 2) a variable slip which approaches zero at the fault edge. The radiation is calculated for distances from the fault which are large compared to the fault dimensions. The body waves are described by the product of two factors, one of which is the familiar equivalent-force system radiation pattern. The other factor includes the time dependence of the signal; it does not depend upon the direction of slip. The body waves exhibit two stopping phases. The theory is used to estimate the fault dimensions associated with six deep-focus earthquakes studied by Kasahara. The estimated fault dimensions are about twice the dimensions of the focal sphere as found by Kasahara. Finally, the difference between the phase spectrums of shallow and deep-focus earthquake radiation observed by Kishimoto is shown to be related to a difference in shape of the two fault surfaces; shallow-focus earthquakes appear to be associated with elongated fault surfaces, whereas deep-focus earthquakes are associated with more circular fault surfaces.},

Records originating from both, analogue and modern digital instruments should be subjected to processing in order to derive credible engineering parameters, such as spectral ordinates. A number of processing procedures have been proposed by many researchers through the past few decades; the goal, however, is always the same, identification and removal of noise and performing necessary adjustments related to the operating instrument or the record?s quality. A careful inspection of previous processing schemes and the design of several development tests related to major processing steps proved to be helpful in determining the necessary features that the presented software should include. These have been incorporated in a Matlab application in order to produce a reliable and user-friendly interface giving the researcher several options on major processing steps. It is noteworthy that this computer program can be used either as an interactive process tool when individual record processing corresponds to the researcher?s needs or, for processing a vast number of records without user supervision and even through a scheduled task. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper aims at studying the influence of material heterogeneity on the stability of explicit time marching schemes for the high-order spectral element discretisation of wave propagation problems. A periodic fluctuation of the density and stiffness parameters is considered, where the period is related to the characteristic element size of the mesh. A new stability criterion is derived analytically for quadratic and cubic one-dimensional spectral elements in heterogeneous materials by using a standard Von Neumann analysis. The analysis presented illustrates the effect of material heterogeneity on the stability limit and also reveals the origin of instabilities that are often observed when the stability limit derived for homogeneous materials is adapted by simply changing the velocity of the wave to account for the material heterogeneity. Several extensions of the results derived for quadratic and cubic one-dimensional spectral elements are discussed, including higher order approximations, different periodicity of the material parameters and higher dimensions. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the validity of the new stability limits derived for heterogeneous materials with periodic fluctuation. Finally numerical examples of the stability for randomly fluctuating material properties are also presented, discussing the applicability of the theoretical limits derived for material properties with periodic fluctuation.},

  Abstract                 = {Detailed source rupture process is inferred for the 2007 Niigata-ken Chuetsu-Oki Earthquake (MJMA 6.8) from regional strong-motion records. For an initial fault model we assume the southeast dipping rectangular fault of 30 km long and 17 km wide, referring to the aftershock distribution relocated through the data from ocean bottom seismometers. The spatio-temporal variation for the seismic moment and the rise time on the fault plane are estimated using the inversion technique composed of the very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) and the empirical Green's function method. The aftershock of MJMA 4.4 which occurred at 21:08 on 16 July is employed as an empirical Green's function. Strong-motion records of two horizontal components from 18 stations, which are located within 50 km from the center of the main shock fault, are used for the inversion. The optimal solution estimated from the inversion analysis shows that three separated asperity areas are recognized, which correspond to three pulses appeared in the strong motion records observed at near-source stations. For rupture time distribution, we find that rupture accelerates abruptly on the third asperity which is most distant from the hypocenter, and the local rupture velocity seems to exceed the S-wave velocity. We further construct the characterized source model which describes the generation of the broadband strong motions based on the inversion result, and estimate the strong motions during the main shock at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station. By assuming radial rupture propagation with individual rupture speed at each asperity, several strong-motion records observed in the NPS site are synthesized well through the characterized source model in which the effective stress on the asperity roughly distributes from 20 to 25 MPa.},

In particular, the algorithmic elastoplastic tangent moduli of the infinitesimal theory remain unchanged. For the static problem, the proposed class of algorithms preserve exactly plastic volume changes if the yield criterion is pressure insensitive. For the dynamic problem, a class of time-stepping algorithms is presented which inherits exactly the conservation laws of total linear and angular momentum.

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that widely used implicit schemes, in particular the classical Newmark family of algorithms and its variants, generally fail to conserve total angular momentum for nonlinear Hamiltonian systems including classical rigid body dynamics, nonlinear elastodynamics, nonlinear rods and nonlinear shells. For linear Hamiltonian systems, it is well known that only the Crank-Nicholson scheme exactly preserves the total energy of the system. This conservation property is typically lost in the nonlinear regime. A general class of implicit time-stepping algorithms is presented which preserves exactly the conservation laws present in a general Hamiltonian system with symmetry, in particular the total angular momentum and the total energy. Remarkably, the actual implementation of this class of algorithms can be effectively accomplished by means of a simple two-step solution scheme which results in essentially no added computational cost relative to standard implicit methods. A complete analysis of these algorithms and a related class of schemes referred to as symplectic integrators is given. The good performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by means of three numerical examples which constitute representative model problems of nonlinear elastodynamics, nonlinear rods and nonlinear shells.},

The schemes are designed for use in finite element plasticity calculations and solve for the stress increments assuming that the strain increments are known. Both methods are applicable to a general type of constitutive law and control the error in the integration process by adjusting the size of each substep automatically. The first method is based on the well-known modified Euler scheme, whereas the second technique employs a high order Runge-Kutta formula. The procedures outlined do not require any form of stress correction to prevent drift from the yield surface. Their utility is illustrated by analysis of typical boundary value problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study earthquake ground motion in the Thessaloniki urban area is evaluated using a 3D spectral element numerical approach. The availability of detailed geotechnical/geophysical data from past microzonation studies together with the seismological information regarding the relevant fault sources allowed for the creation of a large-scale 3D numerical model. The latter is suitable for generating finite-fault physics-based ground shaking scenarios within the city of Thessaloniki up to maximum frequencies of about 1.5 Hz. As a representative case study, the simulation of the historical MW 6.5 June 20th 1978 Volvi earthquake is addressed. The results show that reasonable estimates can be obtained in terms both of ground motion time histories at the only available strong motion station and of spatial distribution of peak ground motion parameters, as compared to the regional map of macroseismic intensity and to the predictions of attenuation laws. The numerical model is, then, used to provide insights into 3D site effects occurring in the city of Thessaloniki, by showing the comparison between synthetic and experimental Standard Spectral Ratios (SSR) as well as the effect of non-linear visco-elastic soil behavior and the spatial variability of amplification factors with respect to outcrop bedrock basement. The results of this study demonstrate the potentialities of 3D physics-based numerical modeling for deterministic-based seismic hazard assessment studies in large urban areas characterized by complex geological configurations, such as the Thessaloniki area.},

Multiple point source modeling, nonlinear slip patch, and linear slip inversions reveal a coherent rupture image with directivity toward the southwest and several moment release episodes, reflected in the complex aftershock distribution. The key feature is that the 2015 earthquake ruptured a strong asperity, which was left unbroken in between two large subevents of the M w 6.2 Lefkada doublet in 2003. This finding and the well-analyzed Cephalonia earthquake sequence of 2014 provide strong evidence of segmentation of the major dextral Cephalonia-Lefkada Transform Fault (CTF), being related to extensional duplex transform zones. We propose that the duplexes extend farther to the north and that the CTF runs parallel to the western coast of Lefkada and Cephalonia Islands, considerably closer to the inhabited islands than previously thought. Generally, this study demonstrates faulting complexity across short time scales (earthquake doublets) and long time scales (seismic gaps).},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study is to develop and test a procedure for simulating acceleration time histories of large subduction earthquakes. The ground motions of the large event are obtained by summing contributions from fault elements to simulate the propagation of rupture over the fault surface. The radiation from the fault elements is represented by empirical source functions derived from near-source strong motion recordings of Mw = 7 aftershocks, and gross aspects of wave propagation are modeled by calculated Green{\textquoteright}s functions. The procedure has been tested against the recorded strong ground motions of the Mw = 8.0 Michoac{\'a}n, Mexico, and Valparaiso, Chile, earthquakes of 1985. We find that models of heterogeneous slip in these events derived by other investigators from the analysis of teleseismic and near-source velocity seismograms also explain the shorter period motions of the recorded accelerograms. The response spectra of the simulated motions generally have little or no significant bias in the period range of 0.05 to 2 sec for both earthquakes. Also, the peak accelerations, durations, and envelope shapes of the time histories are in good agreement with the recorded motions. The uncertainty associated with the modeling procedure, estimated from the misfit between recorded and simulated response spectra, shows a dependence on period and site conditions. This uncertainty estimate includes the uncertainty involved in using empirical source functions derived from one subduction zone to simulate strong ground motions in another subduction zone. The procedure is applied in a companion paper (Cohee et al., 1991) to estimate strong ground motion characteristics in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States from hypothesized Mw = 8 subduction earthquakes on the Cascadia plate interface.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies in dynamic source modeling and kinematic source inversion show that earthquake rupture may contain greater complexity than we previously anticipated, including multiple slipping at a given point on a fault. Finite source inversion methods suffer from the nonuniqueness of solutions, and it may become more serious if we aim to resolve more complex rupture models. In this study, we perform synthetic inversion tests with dynamically generated complex rupture models, including both supershear rupture and slip reactivation, to understand the possibility of resolving complex rupture processes by inverting seismic waveform data. We adopt a linear source inversion method with multiple windows, allowing for slipping from the nucleation of rupture to the termination at all locations along a fault. We regularize the model space effectively in the Bayesian framework and perform multiple inversion tests by considering the effect of inaccurate Green's functions and station distributions. We also perform a spectral stability analysis. Our results show that it may be possible to resolve both a supershear rupture front and reactivated secondary slipping using the linear inversion method if those complex features are well separated from the main rupture and produce a fair amount of seismic energy. It may be desirable to assume the full complexity of an earthquake rupture when we first develop finite source models after a major event occurs and then assume a simple rupture model for stability if the estimated models do not show a clear pattern of complex rupture processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Scientific workflows need to be iteratively, and often interactively, executed for large input datasets. Reducing data from input datasets is a powerful way to reduce overall execution time in such workflows. When this is accomplished online ( i . e . , without requiring the user to stop execution to reduce the data, and then resume), it can save much time. However, determining which subsets of the input data should be removed becomes a major problem. A related problem is to guarantee that the workflow system will maintain execution and data consistent with the reduction. Keeping track of how users interact with the workflow is essential for data provenance purposes. In this paper, we adopt the “human-in-the-loop” approach, which enables users to steer the running workflow and reduce subsets from datasets online. We propose an adaptive workflow monitoring approach that combines provenance data monitoring and computational steering to support users in analyzing the evolution of key parameters and determining the subset of data to remove. We extend a provenance data model to keep track of users’ interactions when they reduce data at runtime. In our experimental validation, we develop a test case from the oil and gas domain, using a 936-cores cluster. The results on this test case show that the approach yields reductions of 32% of execution time and 14% of the data processed. },

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the problem of calculating high-frequency ground motions (\&gt;1 Hz) caused by earthquakes having arbitrary spatial variations of rupture velocity and slip velocity (or stress drop) over the fault. We approximate the elastic wave Green{\textquoteright}s functions by far-field body waves, which we calculate using geometric ray theory. However, we do not make the traditional Fraunhofer approximation, so our method may be used close to large faults. The method is confined to high frequencies (greater than about 1 Hz) due to the omisson of near-field terms, and must be used at source-observer distances less than a few source depths, due to the omission of surface waves. It is easily used in laterally varying velocity structures. Assuming a simple parameterization of the slip function, the computational problem collapses to the evaluation of a series of line integrals over the fault, with one line integral per each time ti in the observer seismogram. The path of integration corresponding to observation time ti consists of only those points on the fault which radiate body waves arriving at the observer at exactly time ti. This path is an isochron of the arrival time function. An isochron velocity may be defined that depends on rupture velocity and resembles the usual directivity function. Observed ground motions are directly dependent upon this isochron velocity. Ground velocity is proportional to isochron velocity and ground acceleration is proportional to isochron acceleration in dislocation models of rupture. Ground acceleration may also be related to spatial variations of slip velocity on the fault, using the square of isochron velocity as a constant of proportionality. We show two rupture models, one with variable slip velocity and the other with variable rupture velocity, that cause the same ground acceleration at a single observer. The computational method is shown to produce reasonably accurate synthetic seismograms, compared to a method using complete Green{\textquoteright}s functions, and requires about 0.5 per cent of the computer time. It may be very effective in calculating ground motions in the frequency band 1 to 10 Hz at observers within a few source depths of large earthquakes, where most of the high-frequency motions may be caused by direct P and S waves. We suggest a possible method for inverting ground motions for both slip velocity and rupture velocity over the fault.},

This paper provides a brief synthesis of ground motion analysis procedures within a performance-based design framework, and is a summary of a recent report to which the reader is referred for details.

  Abstract                 = {One-dimensional seismic ground response analyses are often performed using equivalent-linear procedures, which require few, generally well-known parameters. Nonlinear analyses have the potential to more accurately simulate soil behavior, but implementation in practice has been limited because of poorly documented and unclear parameter selection and code usage protocols, as well as inadequate documentation of the benefits of nonlinear modeling relative to equivalent- linear modeling. Regarding code usage/parameter selection protocols, we note the following: (1) when input motions are from ground surface recordings, we show that the full outcropping motion should be used without converting to a {\textquotedblleft}within{\textquotedblright} condition; (2) Rayleigh damping should be specified using at least two matching frequencies with a target level equal to the small-strain soil damping; (3) the {\textquotedblleft}target{\textquotedblright} soil backbone curves used in analysis can be parameterized to capture either the soil{\textquoteright}s dynamic shear strength when large-strain soil response is expected (strains approaching 1{\%}), relatively small-strain response (i.e., $\gamma$ < 0.3{\%}) as inferred from cyclic laboratory tests, or a hybrid of the two; (4) models used in nonlinear codes inevitably represent a compromise between the optimal fitting of the shapes of backbone and hysteretic damping curves, and we present two alternatives for model parameterization. The parameter selection and code usage protocols are tested by comparing predictions to data from vertical arrays. We find site amplification to be generally underpredicted at high frequencies and overpredicted at the elastic site period where a strong local resonance occurs that is not seen in the data. We speculate that this bias results from overdamping.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, fire safety engineers are increasingly relying on sophisticated numerical simulators, typically based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers, to conduct their analyses. However, the complexity of these numerical models often limits drastically the number of simulations that can be afforded, making traditional methods of safety analysis difficult or impossible to apply. This paper proposes a statistical method to evaluate a quantity of interest with an expensive simulator while saving computation time. The method is based on Bayesian statistics and multi-fidelity. We use Gaussian process regression to construct a Bayesian model of the complex simulator. This model is based on a multi-fidelity approach, which consists in simulating at different levels of accuracy, for instance by varying the spatial discretization in a CFD solver. We illustrate the method on an example of fire safety analysis, where the quantity of interest is the probability of exceeding a tenability threshold in a building on fire.},

  Abstract                 = {Near-fault effects are known to produce specific features of earthquake ground motion (such as long-period velocity pulses and directivity) that cannot be predicted by numerical approaches involving vertical plane wave propagation in one-dimensional (1D) soil models that are used as a standard in engineering applications. Coupling near-fault conditions with site effects induced by complex geological structures (such as deep alluvial basins or steep topographic irregularities) further contributes to the complexity of earthquake ground motion and to the difficulty to provide reliable predictions without making use of large-size 3D numerical simulations. In this article, we present a parametric study of the seismic response of the Grenoble Valley, France (due to an Mw~6 seismic source at some 10~km epicentral distance from the urban area) that was carried out in the framework of an international benchmark for earthquake ground-motion prediction. The spectral element code GeoELSE for seismic-wave propagation analyses in 3D heterogeneous media, in the linear and nonlinear range, was used for this purpose; full advantage was taken of its implementation on parallel computer architectures. After introducing GeoELSE and its parallel performance, and after introducing some of its validation benchmarks, the spatial variability of the seismic response of the Grenoble Valley is quantitatively investigated taking into account two effects: (i)~the hypocenter location and (ii)~the nonlinear soil behavior through a nonlinear viscoelastic soil model. Finally, numerical results are compared with available data and attenuation relationships of peak values of ground motion in the near-fault region. Based on the results of this work, the unfavorable interaction between fault rupture, radiation mechanism, and complex geological conditions may give rise to large values of peak ground velocity (exceeding 1 m/sec) even in low-to-moderate seismicity areas; it may therefore considerably increase the level of seismic risk, especially in highly populated and industrially active regions, such as the Alpine valleys.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a simulation of the 2008 Mw�5.4 Chino Hills earthquake for a maximum frequency up to 4�Hz and a minimum shear-wave velocity down to 200 m/s and perform a validation study comparing data obtained from seismic networks with simulation synthetics on more than 300 recording stations. The simulation was done using a parallel-computing code for earthquake simulations that implements a finite-element solution to anelastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media. The source model corresponds to that of an independent inversion study, and the material model used is a community velocity model (CVM) developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC). Our results for the goodness-of-fit measure of the synthetics indicate that, from a regional perspective, the simulation starts to deviate from the data at frequencies above 1 and 2�Hz. At particular locations or station clusters, however, the synthetics yield very good results, even at frequencies between 2 and 4�Hz. The best results are obtained between 0.1 and 0.25�Hz over the entire region and up to 1�Hz within the major basins. These and other results from comparisons at boreholes, biases of the peak surface response, and the differences in the strong-phase duration of the waveforms and the arrival time of P waves suggest a strong sensitivity to seismic velocities. In particular, the CVM used seems to misrepresent the shallow soil deposits and overestimate seismic velocities in the upper layers outside the basins. These observations are helpful in identifying regions where the velocity model may need to be revised. Overall, this study shows that extending the maximum frequency for deterministic earthquake simulations beyond 1�Hz is an effort worth pursuing.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The lateral (along trench axis) variation in the mode of large earthquake occurrence near the northern Japan Trench is explained by the variation in surface roughness of the subducting plate. The surface roughness of the ocean bottom near the trench is well correlated with the large-earthquake occurrence. The region where the ocean bottom is smooth is correlated with?typical?large underthrust earthquakes (e.g. the 1968 Tokachioki event) in the deeper part of the seismogenic plate interface, and there are no earthquakes in the shallow part (aseismic zone). The region where the ocean bottom is rough (well-developed horst and graben structure) is correlated with large normal faulting earthquakes (e.g. the 1933 Sanriku event) in the outer-rise region, and large tsunami earthquakes (e.g. the 1896 Sanriku event) in the shallow region of the plate interface zone. In the smooth surface region, the coherent metamorphosed sediments form a homogeneous, large and strong contact zone between the plates. The rupture of this large strong contact causes great under-thrust earthquakes. In the rough surface region, large outer-rise earthquakes enhance the well-developed horst and grabens. As these structure are subducted with sediments in the graben part, the horsts create enough contact with the overriding block to cause an earthquake in the shallow part of the interface zone, and this earthquake is likely to be a tsunami earthquake. When the horst and graben structure is further subducted, many small strong contacts between the plates are formed, and they can cause only small underthrust earthquakes.},

The difference between the ETF and either of the TTFs is substantially larger than the difference between the two TTFs computed from different estimates of the seismic properties. We show that the plane SH-wave TTF through a laterally homogeneous medium at vertical incidence inade- quately models observed amplifications at most sites for both slowness estimates, obtained via downhole measurements and the spectral analysis of surface waves. Strategies to improve the predictions can be separated into two broad categories: improving the measurement of soil properties and improving the theory that maps the 1D soil profile onto spectral amplification. Using an example site where the 1D plane SH-wave formulation poorly predicts the ETF, we find a more satisfactory fit to the ETF by modeling the full wavefield and incorporating spatially correlated variability of the seismic properties. We conclude that our ability to model the ob- served site response transfer function is limited largely by the assumptions of the theoretical formulation rather than the uncertainty of the soil property estimates.},

Based on an elastic wave oriented formulation and using a tensorial formalism, the proposed framework allows a better understanding of the physical meaning of the terms involved in the discontinuous Galerkin method. The unified variational framework is written for first-order velocity–stress wave equations. An uncoupled upwind numerical flux and two coupled upwind numerical fluxes using respectively the Voigt and the Reuss averages of elastic moduli are defined. Two numerical fluxes that are exact solutions of the Riemann problem on physical interfaces are also developed and analyzed in the 1D case. The implemented solvers are then applied to different elastic media, especially to polycrystalline materials that present a particular case of piecewise homogeneous media. The use of the three upwind numerical fluxes, which only solve approximately the Riemann problem at element interfaces, is investigated.},

The peak ground accelerations recorded were as large as 6.7 m/s2 in Kashiwazaki city and 12.2 m/s2 in the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant. The damage to the city caused by ground shaking, however, appeared to be limited to very old buildings whereas that caused by ground failure extended to both old and new buildings as well as many infrastructures in alluvial deposits and sand dune slopes. The operation of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant was automatically shutdown and all the critical structures seemed to be in good condition; however, a fire broke out around a house electric transformer and many non-critical structures as well as incidental components such as pipes and ducts were damaged, retarding the re-operation of the plant. The major cause of the damage including the fire at the site seemed to be not only the near field strong ground motions but also the settlements of backfill around the critical buildings. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This work deals with the evaluation of the effects of the spatial variability of earthquake input motion on the dynamic response of structures. The variability of the free-field motion both over the area of a single foundation as well as over the distance between independent foundations of large structures is considered. Two significant applications of the proposed numerical procedure are presented. In the first one a base isolated nuclear reactor building is considered where the issue of the rocking excitation on the peak value of axial forces in the isolation devices and acceleration in the building structure is investigated. Extended structures having tall members are considered as second application. A cable-supported bridge model, formerly studied within a simpler representation of the seismic ground motion, serves as case study in which spatial variability acts at different scales. },

  Abstract                 = { A new numerical analysis procedure is presented for the nonlinear analysis of structures. The proposed methodology is developed within the framework of the direct stiffness method and the hysteretic formulation of finite elements. The derived numerical scheme relies on the natural evolution of localized inelastic quantities within the element, that is, the plastic deformation evaluated at properly defined collocation points rather than the evaluation of global and varying state matrices. This is accomplished by considering the additive decomposition of the total strain rate into elastic and plastic parts. Using the principle of virtual work, an equilibrium expression is derived in which the total applied load is equilibrated by an elastic internal force vector and an additional term acting as a nonlinear correction to the elastic component. The evolution of the plastic components is based on a smooth multiaxial hysteretic law that is derived within the framework of classical plasticity. Examples are presented that demonstrate the validity of the proposed method and its computational advantages with respect to existing methods of inelastic analysis. },

The earthquake was a multiple event sequence with at least 4 events recorded at El Centro in the first 25 seconds, followed by 9 events recorded in the next 5 minutes. Clear P, S, and surface waves were observed on the strong motion record. Although the main part of the earthquake energy was released during the first 15 seconds, some of the later events were as large as M = 5.8 and thus are important for earthquake engineering studies. The moment calculated using Fourier analysis of surface waves agrees with the moment estimated from field measurements of fault offset after the earthquake. The earthquake engineering significance of the complex pattern of energy release is discussed. It is concluded that a cumulative increase in amplitudes of building vibration resulting from the present sequence of shocks would be significant only for structures with relatively long natural period of vibration. However, progressive weakening effects may also lead to greater damage for multiple event earthquakes.},

To realize these large-scale computations, we optimize a widely used community software code to efficiently address all hardware parallelization, especially thread-level parallelization to solve the bottleneck of memory usage for coarse-grained parallelization. The new code exhibits excellent strong scaling for the time stepping loop, that is, parallel efficiency on 82,134 nodes relative to 36,504 nodes is 99.54\%. Sustained performance of these computations on the K computer is 1.24 petaflops, which is 11.84\% of its peak performance. The obtained seismograms with an accuracy of 1.2 s for the entire globe should help us to better understand rupture mechanisms of devastating earthquakes. },

  Abstract                 = {The 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku earthquake (Tohoku earthquake, M w 9.0) occurred on the Japan Trench and caused a devastating tsunami. Studies of this earthquake have revealed complex features of its rupture process. In particular, the shallow parts of the fault (near the trench) hosted large slip and long period seismic wave radiation, whereas the deep parts of the rupture (near the coast) hosted smaller slip and strong radiation of short period seismic waves. Understanding such depth-dependent feature of the rupture process of the Tohoku earthquake is necessary as it may occur during future mega-thrust earthquakes in this and other regions. In this study, we investigate the ``characterized source model'' of the Tohoku earthquake through dynamic rupture simulations. This source model divides the fault plane into several parts characterized by different size and frictional strength (main asperity, background area, etc.) and is widely used in Japan for the prediction of strong ground motion and tsunami through kinematic rupture simulations. Our characterized source model of the Tohoku earthquake comprises a large shallow asperity with moderate frictional strength, small deep asperities with high frictional strength, a background area with low frictional strength, and an area with dynamic weakening close to the trench (low dynamic friction coefficient as arising from, e.g., thermal pressurization). The results of our dynamic rupture simulation reproduce the main depth-dependent feature of the rupture process of the Tohoku earthquake. We also find that the width of the area close to the trench (equal to the distance from the trench to the shallow asperity, interpreted as the size of the accretionary prism) and the presence of dynamic weakening in this area have a significant influence on the final slip distribution. These results are useful to construct characterized source models for other subduction zones with different scale of the accretionary prism, such as the Chile subduction zone and the Nankai Trough. Dynamic rupture simulations based on the characterized source model might provide useful insights for hazard assessment associated with future mega-thrust earthquakes.},

  Abstract                 = {Parallel supercomputing has traditionally focused on the inner kernel of scientific simulations: the solver. The front and back ends of the simulation pipeline - problem description and interpretation of the output - have taken a back seat to the solver when it comes to attention paid to scalability and performance, and are often relegated to offline, sequential computation. As the largest simulations move beyond the realm of the terascale and into the petascale, this decomposition in tasks and platforms becomes increasingly untenable. We propose an end-to-end approach in which all simulation components - meshing, partitioning, solver, and visualization - are tightly coupled and execute in parallel with shared data structures and no intermediate I/O. We present our implementation of this new approach in the context of octree-based finite element simulation of earthquake ground motion. Performance evaluation on up to 2048 processors demonstrates the ability of the end-to-end approach to overcome the scalability bottlenecks of the traditional approach},

  Abstract                 = {The definition of a fractal distribution is that the number of objects N with a characteristic size greater than r scales with the relation N {\textasciitilde} r −D . The frequency-size distributions for islands, earthquakes, fragments, ore deposits, and oil fields often satisfy this relation. Fractals were originally introduced by Mandelbrot to relate the length of a coastline to the length of the measuring stick. This application illustrates a fundamental aspect of fractal distributions, scale invariance. The requirement of an object to define a scale in photographs of many geological features is one indication of the wide applicability of scale invariance to geological problems, scale invariance can lead to fractal clustering. Geophysical spectra can also be related to fractals; these are self-affine fractals rather than self-similar fractals. Examples include the earth's topography and geoid.},

An efficient methodology is presented for applying these approaches to the classification of seismic records. The proposed procedure is applied to mining seismicity from two mines in Ontario, Canada, and compared based on an analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve as well as a number of performance metrics related to the contingency matrix. The logistic and neural network models presented excellent performance for identifying blasts, seismic events and reported events in the training and testing datasets for both mining seismicity catalogues. Operated under their respective optimal decision threshold values, the logistic and neural network models, accuracy was higher than 95% for classification of seismic records. In general, the logistic regression and neural network methods had close overall classification accuracies. The ability of the models to reproduce the frequency-magnitude distribution of the testing dataset was used as a signature of classification quality. The logistic and neural network models reproduced the reference distribution in a satisfactory manner. The advantages and limitations pertaining to the two classifiers are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {An analysis is presented of a database of 67 tests on 21 clays and silts of undrained shear stress-strain data of fine-grained soils. Normalizations of secant G in terms of initial mean effective stress p9 (i.e., G=p9 versus log g) or undrained shear strength cu (i.e., G=cu versus log g) are shown to be much less successful in reducing the scatter between different clays than the approach that uses the maximum shear modulus,Gmax, a technique still not universally adopted by geotechnical researchers and constitutive modelers. Analysis of semiempirical expressions forGmax is presented and a simple expression that uses only a void-ratio function and a confining-stress function is proposed. This is shown to be superior to a Hardin-style equation, and the void ratio function is demonstrated as an alternative to an overconsolidation ratio (OCR) function.Toderive correlations that offer reliable estimates of secant stiffness at any required magnitude of working strain, secant shear modulus G is normalized with respect to its small-strain value Gmax, and shear strain g is normalized with respect to a reference strain gref at which this stiffness has halved. The data are corrected to two standard strain rates to reduce the discrepancy between data obtained from static and cyclic testing. The reference strain gref is approximated as a function of the plasticity index.Aunique normalized shear modulus reduction curve in the shape of a modified hyperbola isfitted to all the available data up to shear strains of the order of1{\%}.Asa result, good estimates can bemadeof the modulus reductionG=Gmax630{\%} across all strain levels in approximately 90{\%} of the cases studied. Newdesign charts are proposed to update the commonly used design curves.},

autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting
algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however
shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error,
thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpass-
ing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the
performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordi-
nary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural
image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value
of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful
higher level representations.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a finite difference method that is especially adapted to the study of dynamic shear cracks. We studied a number of simple earthquake source models in two and three dimensions with special emphasis on the modeling of the stress field. We compared our numerical results for semi-infinite and self-similar shear cracks with the few exact solutions that are available in the literature. We then studied spontaneous rupture propagation with the help of a maximum stress criterion. From dimensional arguments and a few simple examples, we showed that the maximum stress criterion depended on the physical dimensions of the fault. For a given maximum stress intensity, the finer the numerical mesh, the higher the maximum stress that had to be adopted. A study of in-plane cracks showed that at high rupture velocities, the numerical results did not resolve the stress concentration due to the rupture front from the stress peak associated with the shear wave propagating in front of the crack. We suggest that this is the reason why transonic rupture velocities are found in the numerical solutions of in-plane faulting when the rupture resistance is rather low. Finally, we studied the spontaneous propagation of an initially circular rupture. Two distinct modes of nucleation of the rupture were studied. In the first, a plane circular shear crack was formed instantaneously in a uniformly prestressed medium. After a while, once stress concentrations had developed around the crack edge, the rupture started to grow. In the second type of nucleation, a preexisting circular crack became unstable at time t = 0 and started to grow. The latter model appeared to us as a more realistic simulation of earthquake triggering. In this case, the initial stress was nonuniform and was the static field of the preexisting fault.},

  Abstract                 = {A nonlinear kinematic hardening rule is developed here within the framework of thermodynamic principles. The derived kinematic hardening evolution equation has three distinct terms: two strain hardening terms and a dynamic recovery term that operates at all times. The proposed hardening rule, which is referred in this paper as the FAPC (Fredrick and Armstrong-Phillips-Chaboche) kinematic hardening rule, shows a combined form of the Frederick and Armstrong backstress evolution equation, Phillips evolution equation, and Chaboche series rule. A new term is incorporated into the Frederick and Armstrong evolution equation that appears to have agreement with the experimental observations that show the motion of the center of the yield surface in the stress space is directed between the gradient to the surface at the stress point and the stress rate direction at that point. The model is further modified in order to simulate nonproportional cyclic hardening by proposing a measure representing the degree of nonproportionality of loading. This measure represents the topology of the incremental stress path. Numerically, it represents the angle between the current stress increment and the previous stress increment, which is interpreted through the material constants of the kinematic hardening evolution equation. This new kinematic hardening rule is incorporated in a material constitutive model based on the von Mises plasticity type and the Chaboche isotropic hardening type. Numerical integration of the incremental elasto-plastic constitutive equations is based on a simple semi-implicit return-mapping algorithm and the full Newton-Raphson iterative method is used to solve the resulting nonlinear equations. Experimental simulations are conducted for proportional and non-proportional cyclic loadings. The model shows good correlation with the experimental results. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Using strong-motion data recorded in the Los Angeles region from the 1992 (Mw 7.3) Landers earthquake, we have tested the accuracy of existing three-dimensional (3D) velocity models on the simulation of long-period (≧2 sec) ground motions in the Los Angeles basin and surrounding San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys. First, the overall pattern and degree of long-period excitation of the basins were identified in the observations. Within the Los Angeles basin, the recorded amplitudes are about three to four times larger than at sites outside the basins; amplitudes within the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are nearly a factor of 3 greater than surrounding bedrock sites. Then, using a 3D finite-difference numerical modeling approach, we analyzed how variations in 3D earth structure affect simulated waveforms, amplitudes, and the fit to the observed patterns of amplification. Significant differences exist in the 3D velocity models of southern California that we tested (Magistrale et al., 1996; Graves, 1996a; Hauksson and Haase, 1997). Major differences in the models include the velocity of the assumed background models; the depth of the Los Angeles basin; and the depth, location, and geometry of smaller basins. The largest disparities in the response of the models are seen for the San Fernando Valley and the deepest portion of the Los Angeles basin. These arise in large part from variations in the structure of the basins, particularly the effective depth extent, which is mainly due to alternative assumptions about the nature of the basin sediment fill. The general ground-motion characteristics are matched by the 3D model simulations, validating the use of 3D modeling with geologically based velocity-structure models. However, significant shortcomings exist in the overall patterns of amplification and the duration of the long-period response. The successes and limitations of the models for reproducing the recorded ground motions as discussed provide the basis and direction for necessary improvements to earth structure models, whether geologically or tomographically derived. The differences in the response of the earth models tested also translate to variable success in the ability to successfully model the data and add uncertainty to estimates of the basin response given input {\textquotedblleft}scenario{\textquotedblright} earthquake source models.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed an efficient method to determine high-resolution hypocenter locations over large distances. The location method incorporates ordinary absolute travel-time measurements and/or cross-correlation P- and S-wave differential travel-time measurements. Residuals between observed and theoretical travel-time differences (or double-differences) are minimized for pairs of earthquakes at each station while linking together all observed event-station pairs. A least-squares solution is found by iteratively adjusting the vector difference between hypocentral pairs. The double-difference algorithm minimizes errors due to unmodeled velocity structure without the use of station corrections. Because catalog and cross-correlation data are combined into one system of equations, interevent distances within multiplets are determined to the accuracy of the cross-correlation data, while the relative locations between multiplets and uncorrelated events are simultaneously determined to the accuracy of the absolute travel-time data. Statistical resampling methods are used to estimate data accuracy and location errors. Uncertainties in double-difference locations are improved by more than an order of magnitude compared to catalog locations. The algorithm is tested, and its performance is demonstrated on two clusters of earthquakes located on the northern Hayward fault, California. There it collapses the diffuse catalog locations into sharp images of seismicity and reveals horizontal lineations of hypocenters that define the narrow regions on the fault where stress is released by brittle failure.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital algorithms for robust detection of phase arrivals in the presence of stationary and nonstationary noise have a long history in seismology and have been exploited primarily to reduce the amount of data recorded by data logging systems to manageable levels. In the present era of inexpensive digital storage, how- ever, such algorithms are increasingly being used to flag signal segments in contin- uously recorded digital data streams for subsequent processing by automatic and/or expert interpretation systems. In the course of our development of an automated, near-real-time, waveform correlation event-detection and location system (WCEDS), we have surveyed the abilities of such algorithms to enhance seismic phase arrivals in teleseismic data streams. Specifically, we have considered envelopes generated by energy transient (STA/LTA), Z-statistic, frequency transient, and polarization algo- rithms. The WCEDS system requires a set of input data streams that have a smooth, low-amplitude response to background noise and seismic coda and that contain peaks at times corresponding to phase arrivals. The algorithm used to generate these input streams from raw seismograms must perform well under a wide range of source, path, receiver, and noise scenarios. Present computational capabilities allow the ap- plication of considerably more robust algorithms than have been historically used in real time. However, highly complex calculations can still be computationally pro- hibitive for current workstations when the number of data streams become large. While no algorithm was clearly optimal under all source, receiver, path, and noise conditions tested, an STA/LTA algorithm incorporating adaptive window lengths con- trolled by nonstationary seismogram spectral characteristics was found to provide an output that best met the requirements of a global correlation-based event-detection and location system.},

  abstract  = {The spontaneous generation of brittle rock damage near and behind the tip of a propagating rupture can produce dynamic feedback mechanisms that modify significantly the rupture properties, seismic radiation, and generated fault zone structure. In this work, we study such feedback mechanisms for single rupture events and their consequences for earthquake physics and various possible observations. This is done through numerical simulations of in-plane dynamic ruptures on a frictional fault with bulk behavior governed by a brittle damage rheology that incorporates reduction of elastic moduli in off-fault yielding regions. The model simulations produce several features that modify key properties of the ruptures, local wave propagation, and fault zone damage. These include (1) dynamic generation of near-fault regions with lower elastic properties, (2) dynamic changes of normal stress on the fault, (3) rupture transition from crack-like to a detached pulse, (4) emergence of a rupture mode consisting of a train of pulses, (5) quasi-periodic modulation of slip rate on the fault, and (6) asymmetric near-fault ground motion with higher amplitude and longer duration on the side with reduced elastic moduli. The results can have significant implications to multiple topics ranging from rupture directivity and local amplification of seismic motion to near-fault tremor-like signals.},

This paper is part of a concerted effort at the Nottingham Centre for Geomechanics to develop improved theoretical foundations for pavement and railtrack design. It is mainly concerned with the development of rigorous lower-bound solutions for shakedown of cohesive-frictional materials under three-dimensional moving traffic loads. Compared with previous studies, two important aspects are taken into account. First, this paper considers a more general case of elliptical contact area between traffic and material surface, as most previous lower-bound studies considered the traffic load is applied through an infinite long roller. Secondly, by introducing a critical self-equilibrated residual stress field, this shakedown problem is reduced to a formulation in terms of a load parameter only. By using a simple optimisation procedure, the maximum load parameter leads to a lower-bound shakedown limit to this problem. Results for the special case of circular contact area are also presented in analytical form, which can then be readily applied for practical design.},

  Abstract                 = {The capability of a bounding surface plasticity model with a vanishing elastic region to capture the multiaxial dynamic hysteretic responses of soil deposits under broadband (eg, earthquake) excitations is explored by using data from centrifuge tests. The said model was proposed by Borja and Amies in 1994 (J. Geotech. Eng., 120, 6, 1051-1070), which is theoretically capable of representing nonlinear soil behavior in a multiaxial setting. This is an important capability that is required for exploring and quantifying site topography, soil stratigraphy, and kinematic effects in ground motion and soil-structure interaction analyses. Results obtained herein indicate that the model can accurately predict key response data recorded during centrifuge tests on embedded specimens?including soil pressures and bending strains for structural walls, structures' racking displacements, and surface settlements?under both low- and high-amplitude seismic input motions, which was achieved after performing only a basic material parameter calibration procedure. Comparisons are also made with results obtained using equivalent linear models and a well-known pressure-dependent multisurface plasticity model, which suggested that the present model is generally more accurate. The numerical convergence behavior of the model in nonlinear equilibrium iterations is also explored for a variety of numerical implementation and model parameter options. To facilitate broader use by researchers and practicing engineers alike, the model is implemented as a "user material" in ABAQUS Standard for implicit time stepping.},

First, a bottom-up surface topology preserving octree-based algorithm is applied to select a starting octree level. Then the dual contouring method is used to extract a preliminary uniform quad/hex mesh, which is decomposed into finer quads/hexes adaptively without introducing any hanging nodes. The positions of all boundary vertices are recalculated to approximate the boundary surface more accurately. Mesh adaptivity can be controlled by a feature sensitive error function, the regions that users are interested in, or finite element calculation results. Finally, a relaxation based technique is deployed to improve mesh quality. Several demonstration examples are provided from a wide variety of application domains. Some extracted meshes have been extensively used in finite element simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a novel 2-refinement algorithm for adaptive all-hexahedral mesh generation based on two tree structures: octree or rhombic dodecahedral tree. Given a smooth boundary surface, we first use a pre-defined error function to detect the main surface features, and build a strongly-balanced octree. Then a novel 2-refinement algorithm is developed to eliminate all hanging nodes in the octree, which is robust for any unstructured meshes and induces a smooth transition with very little propagation. Later, all elements outside and around the boundary are removed to create the octree core mesh and a buffer zone. The boundary points on the core mesh are projected onto the surface and form the final mesh. Motivated from nature, a new tree structure based on rhombic dodecahedron is introduced. Sharp features are also detected and preserved during mesh generation. Finally, pillowing, geometric flow and optimization-based smoothing are applied to improve quality of the constructed meshes. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = { We propose a nodal high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for coupled wave propagation in heterogeneous elastoplastic soil columns. We solve the elastodynamic system written in velocity-strain formulation considering simultaneously the three components of motion. A 3D Iwan elastoplastic model for dry soils under dynamic loading is introduced in the DG method (DG-3C) based on centered fluxes and a low storage Runge?Kutta time scheme. Unlike the linear case, the nonlinear material behavior results in coupling effects between different components of motion. We focus on the choice of the numerical flux for nonlinear heterogeneous media and the classical centered flux is well adapted in terms of stability and direct implementation in 3D. Several numerical applications are studied using a soil column with realistic mechanical properties, and considering successively synthetic and borehole seismic recordings recorded at the Volvi test site (northern Greece). },

The dispersive term in the advection-dispersion equation can overpredict pore-scale mixing, and thereby overpredict homogeneous chemical reaction. We quantified this experimentally by imaging instantaneous colorimetric reactions between solutions of aqueous CuSO4 and EDTA4- within a 30-cm long translucent chamber packed with cryolite sand that closely matched the optical index of refraction of water. A charge-coupled device camera was used to quantify concentrations of blue CuEDTA2- within the chamber as it was produced by mixing of the two reactants at different flow rates. We compared these experimental results with a new analytic solution for instantaneous bimolecular reaction coupled with advection and dispersion of the product and reactants. For all flow rates, the concentrations of CuEDTA2- recorded in the experiments were about 20{\%} less than predicted by the analytic solution, thereby demonstrating that models assuming complete mixing at the pore scale can overpredict reaction during transport.},

  abstract  = {We developed a recipe for predicting strong ground motions based on a characterization of the source model for future crustal earthquakes. From recent developments of waveform inversion of strong motion data used to estimate the rupture process, we have inferred that strong ground motion is primarily related to the slip heterogeneity inside the source rather than average slip in the entire rupture area. Asperities are characterized as regions that have large slip relative to the average slip on the rupture area. The asperity areas, as well as the total rupture area, scale with seismic moment. We determined that the areas of strong motion generation approximately coincide with the asperity areas. Based on the scaling relationships, the deductive source model for the prediction of strong ground motions is characterized by three kinds of parameters: outer, inner, and extra fault parameters. The outer fault parameters are defined as entire rupture area and total seismic moment. The inner fault parameters are defined as slip heterogeneity inside the source, area of asperities, and stress drop on each asperity based on the multiple-asperity model. The pattern of rupture nucleation and termination are the extra fault parameters that are related to geomorphology of active faults. We have examined the validity of the earthquake sources constructed by our recipe by comparing simulated and observed ground motions from recent inland crustal earthquakes, such as the 1995 Kobe and 2005 Fukuoka earthquakes.},

  abstract  = {[1] Noniterative implicit time stepping schemes with adaptive temporal truncation error control are developed for the solution of the pressure form of Richards equation. First- and second-order linearizations of an adaptive backward Euler/Thomas-Gladwell formulation are introduced and are shown to constrain the temporal truncation errors near a filippo-prescribed tolerance and maintain adequate mass balance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that accurate noniterative linearizations achieve cost-effective solutions of problems where soils are described by highly nonlinear and nonsmooth constitutive functions. For these problems many conventional iterative solvers fail to converge. The noniterative formulations are considerably more efficient than analogous time stepping schemes with iterative solvers. The second-order noniterative scheme is found to be more efficient than the first-order noniterative scheme. The proposed adaptive noniterative algorithms can be easily incorporated into existing backward Euler software, which is widely used for Richards equation and other nonlinear PDEs.},

  abstract  = { AbstractThis article proposes a method based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the time history responses at any point on the ground near a shaking table reaction mass (Earthquake Engineering Research Centre, Algiers). The induced vibrations may disturb occupants or damage surrounding buildings. The accelerations generated by the shaking table are used as inputs. The reaction mass and the surrounding soil are modelled using COMSOL Multiphysics software. The natural frequencies were validated experimentally in order to determine the optimum model soil extent. Twenty-one measurements at equal distances from the source were retrieved from the results of the numerical analysis to feed a database with outputs (targets) for a back-propagation feed-forward neural. First, an initial architecture with 2 inputs reached .87 as correlation factor for signal prediction and a maximal error of 17\% for peaks prediction. In order to improve the ANN model, a synchronisation of the input?output signals has been proposed using the cross-correlation product to determine the offset. Further enhancement of the ANN has been achieved by introducing 5 time delays before and after each signal time step. The resulting ANN with 12 inputs reached almost 100\% correlation and less than 2\% error for the peaks prediction. },

In crustal deformation analysis, reflecting the complex geometry and material heterogeneity of the crust is important, and use of large-scale unstructured finite-element method is suitable. However, since the computation area is large, its computation cost has been a bottleneck. In this study, we develop a fast unstructured finite-element solver for GPU-based large-scale computers. By computing several times steps together, we reduce random access, together with the use of predictors suitable for viscoelastic analysis to reduce the total computational cost. The developed solver enabled 2.79 times speedup from the conventional solver. We show an application example of the developed method through a viscoelastic deformation analysis of the Eastern Mediterranean crust and mantle following a hypothetical M�9 earthquake in Greece by using a 2,403,562,056 degree-of-freedom finite-element model.},

Use of elasto-plastic models as the constitutive equation of soils is suitable for evaluation of nonlinear wave propagation with large ground deformation. However, there is no example of elasto-plastic nonlinear wave propagation analysis method capable of simulating a large-scale soil deformation problem. In this study, we developed a scalable elasto-plastic nonlinear wave propagation analysis program based on three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element method. The program attains 86.2{\%} strong scaling efficiency from 240 CPU cores to 3840 CPU cores of PRIMEHPC FX10 based Oakleaf-FX [1], with 8.85 TFLOPS (15.6{\%} of peak) performance on 3840 CPU cores. We verified the elasto-plastic nonlinear wave propagation program through convergence analysis, and conducted an analysis with large deformation for an actual soft ground modeled using 47,813,250 degrees-of-freedom.},

  abstract = {The 1995 Mw 6.5 Kozani-Grevena earthquake struck an area in northwestern Greece characterized by relatively low seismicity based on historical information and instrumental data. The ground shaking in the near-fault region was recorded by a strong-motion accelerograph in the city of Kozani, at a distance of about 23?km from the epicenter. In this article, broadband ground motions are generated at selected locations and at a dense grid of observation points extending over the causative fault of the 1995 Kozani-Grevena earthquake using a hybrid deterministic-stochastic method. Based on a multi-segment fault model with curved geometry proposed in the literature, the low-frequency components of the synthetic ground motion are simulated using the discrete wavenumber representation method and the generalized transmission and reflection coefficient technique. The high-frequency components of the synthetic ground motion are generated using the stochastic modeling approach and the specific barrier model. The two independently derived ground-motion components are then combined using matched filtering at a crossover frequency of 1.2?Hz to generate broadband ground-motion time histories and response spectra. The simulation results are validated by comparing the synthetic ground motions with the recorded ones in the city of Kozani and with estimates of peak ground-motion quantities inferred from ground-motion prediction equations.},

In this work, we investigate the potential use of autoencoder, a deep learning methodology, for de novo molecular design. Various generative autoencoders were used to map molecule structures into a continuous latent space and vice versa and their performance as structure generator was assessed. Our results show that the latent space preserves chemical similarity principle and thus can be used for the generation of analogue structures. Furthermore, the latent space created by autoencoders were searched systematically to generate novel compounds with predicted activity against dopamine receptor type 2 and compounds similar to known active compounds not included in the trainings set were identified.},

  abstract = {Summary In this work, we present alternative implementations for the Simultaneous-FETI (S-FETI) method. Developed in recent years, this method has shown to be very robust for highly heterogeneous problems. However, the memory cost in S-FETI is greatly increased and can be a limitation to its use. Our main objective is to reduce this memory usage without losing significant time performance. The algorithm is based on the exploitation of the sparsity patterns found on the block of search directions, allowing to store less vectors per iteration in comparison to a full storage scheme. In addition, different variations for the S-FETI method are also proposed, including a new treatment for the possible dependencies between directions and the use of the Lumped preconditioner. Several tests are performed in order to establish the impact of the modifications presented in this work compared to the original S-FETI algorithm.},

  abstract = {{Site-effect assessments performed through earthquake-based approaches, such as the standard spectral ratio (SSR), require good quality records of numerous earthquakes. In contrast, the use of ambient noise appears to be an attractive solution for ease and rapid computation of site responses with sufficient spatial resolution (microzonation), especially in low seismicity areas. Two main approaches are tested here: the horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) and the noise-based SSR (SSRn). The HVSR uses the relative amplitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the ambient noise. Instead, the SSRn defines the spectral ratio between the seismic noise recorded simultaneously at a site and at a rock reference station, similar to earthquake-based SSR. While the HVSR is currently used in hundreds of site-specific studies, the SSRn approach has been gradually abandoned since the 1990s. In this study, we compare the results obtain from these two approaches with those of earthquake-based SSR. This comparison is carried out for two sedimentary basins, in Provence (southeastern France) and in Argostoli (western Greece). In agreement with the literature, the HVSR does not provide more than the fundamental resonance frequency of the site (f0). The SSRn leads to overestimation of the SSR amplification factors for frequencies higher than the minimal f0 of the basin (f0min). This discrepancy between SSRn and SSR is discussed, and appears to be mainly dependent on the local geological configuration. We thus introduce the hybrid standard spectral ratio (SSRh) approach, which aims to improve upon the SSRn by adding an intermediate station inside the basin for which the SSR is known. This station is used in turn as a local reference inside the basin for the SSRn computation. The SSRh provides site transfer functions very similar to those of the SSR, in a broad frequency range. Based on these results, the SSRn (or SSRh) should be further tested and should receive renewed attention for microzonation inside sedimentary basins.}},

  abstract  = {We demonstrate that radically differing implementations of finite element methods (FEMs) are needed on multi-core (CPU) and many-core (GPU) architectures, if their respective performance potential is to be realised. Our numerical investigations using a finite element advection-diffusion solver show that increased performance on each architecture can only be achieved by committing to specific and diverse algorithmic choices that cut across the high-level structure of the implementation. Making these commitments to achieve high performance for a single architecture leads to a loss of performance portability. Data structures that include redundant data but enable coalesced memory accesses are faster on many-core architectures, whereas redundancy-free data structures that are accessed indirectly are faster on multi-core architectures. The Addto algorithm for global assembly is optimal on multi-core architectures, whereas the Local Matrix Approach is optimal on many-core architectures despite requiring more computation than the Addto algorithm. These results demonstrate the value in making the correct choice of algorithm and data structure when implementing FEMs, spectral element methods and low-order discontinuous Galerkin methods on modern high-performance architectures.

Accurate modeling of nonstationary coherency can motivate accurate simulation of spatially incoherent ground motions. In this work, wavelet transform and Relevance Vector Machines are used to develop a regression model for nonstationary lagged coherency that characterizes the space-time variation of seismic ground motions. Earthquake data from four events recorded at dense seismograph SMART-1 array is used in the analysis. The nonstationary lagged coherency is computed using the wavelet transform of strong motion S-wave window, and then fed to the Relevance Vector Machine as training data. A homogeneous isotropic field is assumed. The proposed model does not require a fixed parametric functional form. It has been shown that the proposed model can estimate the lagged coherency for different separation distances at different time instants.},

  abstract = {{The observed secondary microseismic wavefield is composed by Rayleigh and Love waves. While the presence and amount of Rayleigh waves is well understood, the generation of Love waves is still under debate. We investigate multiple scattering of surface waves as a possible mechanism that could be responsible for the generation of Love waves in the secondary microseism. We assume that the secondary microseism source generates mainly vertically polarized waves, and that the Love waves are produced during the propagation of the wavefield. To study this hypothesis, we model the wavefield in a highly heterogeneous 3-D half-space with a free surface. To understand the relationship between the surface wave types and the random medium properties, we perform a parameter study. We alter the model fluctuation strength, the correlation length and the layering structure of the medium. We find that the fluctuation strength has a major influence on the Love to Rayleigh ratio. We observe that the Love to Rayleigh ratio reaches a maximum value of 0.4 after approximately 4 scattering mean free paths. This value does not explain the observed Love to Rayleigh ratios in the secondary microseism, which lies between 0.6 and 1.2. Moreover, we would need an unrealistically strongly scattering medium to reach this value. Considering scattering properties similar to those encountered in oceanic crust for wavefields around 0.2 Hz, we obtain a Love to Rayleigh ratio of 0.1, which is significantly below the typically observed ratio of 0.6?1.2.}},

  abstract = {Automatic identification of noisy seismic events is still a problem. The process involves the analysis of complex relationships between data from different sources. Moreover, there are disturbing factors such as poor signal-to-noise ratio, the presence of accidental bursts of man-made noise, and changes in the amplitude and phase of the waves as they travel through the medium. The amount of observed data increases rapidly, so it is imperative to develop suitable and effective methods for processing and analyzing the influx of big data. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) show promise as a disruptive technology that will accelerate and improve analysis of seismic signals. ANNs are easy to apply, and the results often outperform alternative methods. This paper gives an overview of the highs and lows of neural networks, discusses the possibility of routine processing of seismic signals using ANNs, and presents examples of some interesting applications. It is hoped that researchers who read the article will actively use this technique, because ANNs could become more robust and flexible for solving complex problems that currently cannot be solved by the standard approach.},

  abstract = {Summary This paper proposes a new scheme for the generation of Gaussian random fields over large domains (domain size much larger than the correlation length). The scheme decomposes the simulation domain into overlapping subdomains and essentially generates independent random fields over each of them before merging them on the overlaps. It is naturally suited for simulation over clusters of computers. With this approach, the number of operations for each processor depends only on the number of local degrees of freedom and not on the total number over all processors. Hence, weak scalability is perfectly met. This paper describes the general scheme and introduces two error estimates for comparison with classical sampling schemes. Improvements in terms of scalability are demonstrated both theoretically and through numerical examples. The behavior in the overlap is studied in detail. Simulations using the localized approach were performed in up to 512 processors and allowed to generate in 41 seconds a realization of a random field over a cube of side 300 correlation lengths (close to 2-billion sampling points), much more efficiently and rapidly than with classical methods.},

  abstract = {The modification of conforming hexahedral meshes is difficult to perform since their structure does not allow easy local refinement or un-refinement such that the modification does not go through the boundary. In this paper we prove that the set of hex flipping transformations of Bern et al. (2002) [1] is the only possible local modification on a geometrical hex mesh of valence less than five i.e., with less than five edges per vertex. We propose a new basis of transformations that can generate sequences of local modifications on hex meshes of valence less than six. For quadrilateral meshes, we show the equivalence between modifying locally the number of quads on a mesh and the number of its internal vertices.},

  abstract = {Nowadays numerical simulation of soil structure interaction (SSI) is applied to different problems, such as the construction of reliable earthquake-resistant structures. To analyze SSI considering unbounded domains, a numerical implementation of a coupled finite element method (FEM) and scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) approach is used. The FEM discretizes the structures and its surrounding soil (near-field) while the infinite half-space (far-field) is realized by the SBFEM. Both methods are coupled at the near-/ far-field interface, where nodal information is exchanged. Computation of far-field solution involves more effort than the near-field, therefore it is convenient to use a coarser mesh for the far-field than for the near-field. In this work, projection methods are used to exchange nodal information at the non-matching boundary meshes. Their implementations are validated first. Then, a coupled FEM-SBFEM scheme which uses these methods is evaluated in two test problems of the SSI framework. Accuracy and stability of the results are analyzed, as well as memory storage and calculation effort savings. Matching mesh results are considered as reference. The solution scheme is finally used to solve a problem which involves a passing train and buildings placed close to its path, attaining good results.},
